too great a Strain of
Compliment, to dedicate
the following Papers to
you, since they were undertaken
with an Intention of serving
you and some of your
Friends, and are published at
their Request. I am in no great
Pain about their Success, since
you have approved my Part
therein. Popular Applause is
often lost in the two quick

be satisfied.</p>

<p>It may be thought Vanity

my Friends, but I have received
too many Favours
from you, in Instances of some
Consequence to me, not to
reckon you so, which I must
be very insensible not to be
proud of, and ungrateful not
to acknowledge; and to which
the utmost Services in my
Power are but a very inadequate
Return.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected
that any Thing I can say
should add to that Esteem
and Respect you deservedly
hold among all that know
you, and therefore I forbear
to enter into any Parts of your
Character, or your Conduct
in publick and private Life.
The great Stations you so
justly fill, give you Opportunities
of doing kind Actions
out of the Power of
more private Persons, and
of satisfying your Inclinations

are apt rather to out-run
your Power than fall short
of it, and seem bounded

<p class="dropcap"><i>Some Gentlemen of
very great Worth,
whose Desires I could
not resist, engaged me
in the Translation of
the following Treatise of <span class="antiqua">Dolaeus</span>;
they thought it might be of Use
to Persons afflicted with the Gout,
to have an easier Way of coming
at the Facts contained therein, by
naturalizing it into our Language;
to which I can only add
my good Wishes, as I have done
my Endeavours in this Publication;
for its Usefulness must be
judged of by the Event.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span></p>

<p><i>In Examining <span class="antiqua">Dolaeus</span> his Work,
Many Things occurred to me not
so agreeable to my Way of thinking
about these Matters, as I
could have wished consistent with
my publishing thereof, without taking
Notice of them; some necessary
Things I apprehended to be
omitted, some Appearances very
odly accounted for, some Directions
and Medicines too loosely and too
generally recommended; and indeed,
through the whole, too little
Care taken of nicely distinguishing
Constitutions and Habits, to
which Directions of this Kind
should be specifically adapted, and
never applied but upon the most
skillful and mature Advice that
can be had. The too much Encouragement
that hath been given
to valetudinary People, by publishing
such loose and undetermined
Directions, have made them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
think themselves judges of many
Things of great Consequence to
their Lives and Health, for which
they are in no Sort qualified,
and is generally attended with
many great and often fatal Inconveniencies:
And because they
don’t always find Relief by applying
to Physicians, from such Mischiefs
as their own Errors, and
the Neglect of timely Advice have
brought upon them, they are apt
to conceive a bad Opinion both of
the Profession and its Professors.</i></p>

<p><i>The History of Cures, recited
by <span class="antiqua">Dolaeus</span>, I take to be the most
valuable Part of his Book; the
Appearances that happen therein,
may, I think, be accounted for
upon other and more philosophical
Principles, than the Author hath
adapted thereto; upon this, and
the foregoing Accounts, I had determined
to have added Notes at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
such particular Places as were
proper for me to animadvert upon;
but I found they swelled to
too great a Bulk, and would have
too much interrupted the Author
in his own Way of telling his own
Story; which occasioned the changing
thereof into the Form they
now appear in, of a preliminary
Essay.</i></p>

<p><i>The principal Hints in the Essay
are taken from some loose
Papers I have had long by me
upon those Subjects; many of them
were collected upwards of fifteen
Years ago, when I was a very
young Adventurer in Physick; so
that I don’t pretend to call them
all my own, yet I have had long
and frequent Occasion to see the
Truth of them confirmed in many
Instances, and the Pleasure to find
them embraced and applied, by
some of the greatest Masters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
our Profession both at Home and
Abroad. It is a great Loss to
Observations of this Kind, that
the Motions and Quantities of
Matter are so far beyond our Senses,
as to be incapable of being reduced
to any certain Measures, which
prevents that strict Mathematical
Certainty we have arrived at in
the Knowledge of the Properties
of Motion in larger Bodies, more
within the Compass of our Senses;
the Gravitation of the heavenly
Bodies, and of Bodies upon our
Earth, to their respective Centres,
have been reduced to certain
Measure; and that there are
mutual, attractive and repellent
Powers, which act in certain Distances
and Positions, annexed to
the smallest Particles of Matter,
as the immediate Cause of several
natural Appearances, is highly resonable
to believe; but whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Boasts have been made by some of the
modern Philosophers of accounting
for those Appearances upon this
Principle, they have amounted to
no more than Evidences of its
Existence; for the Laws of its
Action are not yet sufficiently
known for such Purposes as I have
been speaking of; so that we must
content ourselves with the History
of Nature, in its Appearances,
which under the same Circumstances
will ever be the same, or at
least as long as we shall have
Occasion to observe them, let their
Causes be what they will.</i></p>

<p><i>I have avoided the Quotation of
Authors through the whole, as much
as possible, because I have observed
that whatever Appearance of honesty
there may be in attributing
to every Author the Hints he may
have furnished, yet, a Multiplicity
of Quotations is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
imputed rather to the Vanity of
appearing Book learned, than any
thing else, except to skreen Defects
under greater Names, by the
Publisher’s not making himself by
this Means accountable for what
he says; the first I think I have
disclaimed, by declining the Occasion,
and the latter could be of
no Use to me, because I hold myself
accountable in this Publication
only for the Truth of the Facts,
and the Honesty of the Intention,
which is to contribute what lies in
my small Sphere to the good of
Mankind, my Friends, and my
Profession.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">It is very well known
in the History of Physick,
that very great
Changes have been
brought about in the
human Body by the Force of Diet,
especially in chronical Cases, where
the Application of Medicines hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
proved ineffectual. Chronical Distempers,
as they are longer in coming
to their Period, so they occasion
a more universal bad Habit
of Body; and where there is a
pretty universal Depravation either
of the Solids or Fluids of a human
Body, or of both, it is not to be
expected that sudden Changes can
happen to Advantage: As the Progress
is slow, and the Changes from
a good to a bad State imperceptible,
and by Degrees, the Changes
to a good State must be so too. In
acute Diseases indeed Medicines are
more immediately necessary, because
the Changes being quick and
violent, immediate and sometimes
violent Remedies become necessary;
there being no Time to wait
the slow and ordinary, tho’ more
certain, Methods of Change by the
Alimentary Powers.</p>

<p>The Gout, of all chronical Distempers,
requires least the Application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of violent or uncertain Remedies:
Tho’ its pain be very intense,
it comes very slow to its Period:
Generally it is many Years,
or the imprudent Application of
Medicines, that brings it into the
noble Parts, so as to endanger Life;
purging by the Bowels hath frequently
brought it into the Stomach;
external Applications of repellent
Plaisters have drove it into
the Head; Applications of Mercurial
Plaisters have brought on Paralytick
Disorders: As we are not
certainly acquainted with the particular
Nature of the Gouty Matter, it
is uncertain how to apply. That
there is somewhat in the Part, not
natural to the Body, which occasions
the Pain, we know; what it
is particularly we know not; the
common Method of Nature is to
evacuate it by the Pores of the Skin
at certain Seasons, which requires
the Part to be kept warm, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
attend upon the Operations of Nature
for Relief; this, and the Uncertainty
of Medicinal Applications,
have brought <i>Patience and
Flannel</i> to be Proverbial to the
Gout.</p>

<p>Since the Cure of the Gout doth
not with Safety admit the Application
of sudden or violent Remedies,
nor the Nature thereof require
them; Physicians have, with very
great Prudence, turned their
Thoughts to other Methods of Cure;
for this End, it was very proper to
consider the Gout as the Distemper
of the Rich and the Lazy, that it
flows chiefly from Idleness and
Fulness of Bread; that Persons afflicted
therewith have naturally
keen Appetites, and are apt to indulge
in larger Quantities and cruder
Kinds of Food, than the digestive
Powers are able to deal
with; that it chiefly happens to
sedentary People; that upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Approach of a Fit of the Gout, and
during the Paroxysm, there are
evident Marks of Indigestion in the
Stomach and Bowels. If we add
hereto the actual Relief that many
Persons have found in the Use of
a proper Diet, we shall not be at a
Loss for a Reason, why Physicians
should expect to find a more certain
and easy Method of Cure in the
Gout by Diet, than by any other
Means.</p>

<p>It is not my Design at present to
enter into the particular History of
the Gout; this is very well known,
and so accurately described by Dr.
<i>Sydenham</i>, that it is needless; nor
to enter into any long Detail of the
History of the Alimentary Powers;
this is likewise sufficiently known;
nor to raise any Altercations about
the particular Quality of the Gouty
Matter, which is unknown, neither
would the Knowledge thereof be
much to my present Purpose. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
will suffice to examine with Accuracy
the Nature of Animal and Vegetable
Diet, and the Habits they
produce in the human Body, and
to apply this to the Nature and
Symptoms of the Gout.</p>

<p>The Knowledge of the particular
Quality of the Gouty Matter is
not absolutely necessary to our present
Purpose; it is sufficient if it be
made to appear, that the whole
Habit of the Body may be changed
by Diet. An Animal is entirely
composed of the Food it is nourished
by, the first <i>Stamen</i>, or Principle
of Life, is most exceedingly
small; and all that it afterwards
receives its Growth from, may properly
enough be called its Food:
In oviparous Animals, and the
same happens in viviparous ones,
(tho’ it be not so much within the
Compass of our Observation) the
first Nourishment is the White of
the Egg, a Fluid very analogous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the <i>Serum</i> of the Blood, and the
Subject of the Encrease is originally
so small as almost to escape the
strictest Enquiry.</p>

<p>Many, if not most Authors, who
have entered into the particular
Quality of the Gouty Matter, have
placed it in an acrimonious acid
Salt, and upon that Scheme have
gone into the Method of a Milk
and Vegetable Diet for the Cure.
The Cure upon this Scheme seems
to me not very rational, because
Milk and Vegetables in their natural
State tend to Acidity; and
the Chalky Substance of the Gout
and Stone in the Bladder (which are
pretty near akin) are soluble only
by <i>Aqua fortis</i>, which is the strongest
Acid. The Digestion of Animal
Food, which is found to encourage,
if not occasion the Gout,
naturally tends to Alcalescence;
and therefore there is more Reason
to conclude the Gouty Matter to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Alkaline than Acid; but the Truth
is, there are no evident Marks of
either Acid or Alkali in the Animal
Juices of an healthy Body, nor of
any other Salt but Sea Salt, which
is taken in with the Food, and as
it is incapable of Change, passes
thro’ the Vessels of the Body. There
is indeed an Acidity discoverable
in the Bowels and lacteal Vessels,
which is doubtless owing to the
acid Food, for it doth not change
its Nature, till it be thoroughly assimilated
with the Blood in several
Circulations; for even in the Chyle
an Acid is sometimes discoverable:
This Acid is lost in the Milk, which
is but one Change farther, tho’
even in this it is evident there is
some Tendency that Way, because
of its Disposition to turn sowre by
standing. As there is doubtless Air
in the Blood, there must be somewhat
Nitrous, because there is no
Air without Nitre, and Nitre is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Acid, but cannot come within Imagination
of occasioning the Gout.
That the Gout should consist in an
Acid, and be curable by acessent
Aliment, the Gouty Chalk dissolved
only by Acids, and the Aliment
that occasions it alkalescent,
would be very strange. On the
contrary, there is as strong Evidence
that the Gouty Matter is not
perfect Alkali, neither is there any
such Thing in the Juices of an healthy
Body; for tho’ Animal Juices
naturally tend to Alkalescence, they
putrify before they arrive at that
State, so as to be incapable of Circulation:
The Disposition of Animal
Juices this Way is so strong,
that if they were not continually
diluted by fresh Portions of Chyle,
they would arrive at that putrescent
Alkaline State that would destroy
the Animal, as is evident in
the Case of Animals starved to
Death. Twenty Days Fasting will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
not diminish the Quantity of the
Blood so much as a large Bleeding,
and in some Kinds of Consumptions
the Diminution of the Solids
and Fluids is much greater than
could happen by being starved;
but in the Case before us, the Juices
turning Alkaline and Corrosive affect
the tender Fibres of the Brain,
and the Animal dies feverish and
delirious: On the contrary, People
have lived above twenty four Days
upon Water only, which can happen
no otherwise than by diluting
the Fluids, and consequently keeping
them from this Alkaline State.
In short, if the Juices of an Animal
Body were either Acid or Alkaline,
so as to cause an Ebullition by Mixture
of their Opposites, they would
burst the Vessels.</p>

<p>I shall consider Vegetable Substances
with regard to Diet, in the
first Place, because they are the
Original Food of all Animals, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
either immediately are nourished
thereby, or else feed upon such Animals
as are nourished by them.</p>

<p>Vegetables receive their Food
from the Air and Earth, by means
of several Recipient Vessels placed
in the Root and Bark, (analogous
to the Lacteals in Animals) conveyed
and diluted by a sufficient
Quantity of Water: This Food
thus received, which I shall beg
Leave to call Vegetable Chyle, is
digested and assimilated in the
Course of Circulation, through the
Vessels of the Plant, till it is converted
into Vegetable Substance,
and is formed into the several differing
Vegetable Juices, Gums, and
Resins, that are peculiar to each
Species of Plants. The Remainder,
after the proper Separations,
is evaporated thro’ the Pores of the
Skin and through the Leaves, in the
Manner of Animal Transpiration.
I content myself here with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
short Hint of Vegetable Nutrition,
because I have treated it more at
large and expresly in another Place:
It is more material at present to examine
the several Juices which circulate
in the Vessels of Vegetables,
because, in regard to Diet, they will
appear to be the Matter of Animal
Nutrition; for the Vessels of Plants
are no other than meer Earth bound
or connected together with Oyl,
by the Means of some very powerful
Attraction: This Earth is undissoluble
by the utmost Force of
Fire, since after burning a Plant in
the open Fire, we find it left entire.</p>

<p>The Chyle of Plants seems to be
made up of whatever Parts in the
Earth are soluble in Water, so as to
be capable of being received into
the Absorbent or Recipient Vessels
of Plants, before taken Notice of;
and consequently may consist of
Salts, Oyls, Fumes of Minerals,
Metals, and other fossil Bodies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
putrified Parts of Animals and Vegetables.
In its first State it is, to
be sure, very crude; but by the
Structure and Fabrick of the Plant,
and the various Vessels it is strained
thro’, it is changed, elaborated, secreted, and
assimilated into the Substance
of the Plant; whence it
follows, that in Vegetables are contained
Salts, Oyl, Water, and Earth,
and probably Metals too, for the
Ashes of Vegetables yield somewhat
which the Load-Stone attracts.</p>

<p>This Juice, when it first enters
the Root, is Earthy, Watry, Poor,
and Acid, it is in the Form of a fine
and subtle Water; the nearer it is
to the Root, the more it retains of
its proper Nature, the further it is
from the Root, and the more Action
it hath sustained it approaches
nearer to a Vegetable Nature, as
will appear by pursuing it a little
further. In the Trunk and Branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it is further prepared, tho’ even
here it is Watry and Acid, as appears
by tapping Trees at the proper
Season: It is more concocted
in the Bud, where the Leaves coming
to be unfolded, serve as Lungs
for the further Preparation of it in
the Course of Circulation; in the
Flower, Leaves and Parts of Generation,
it is still further elaborated,
and becomes in its utmost Perfection,
fine enough to preserve and
nourish the Embryo in the Seeds of
Plants. This Nutritious Juice or
Chyle is pretty universal, and is
found in every Part of a Plant, but
more or less in Quantity, and more
or less impregnated with the more
Elaborate Juices, according to the
Number and Degree of its Circulations.
It seems to be the universal
Diluent and Conveyer of other
and more elaborated Particles. Besides
what I have mentioned, there
are Juices particular to particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Parts of Plants; as Oyl, Wax, and
Manna to the Leaves; Volatile Oyl
or Spirit, and Honey to the Flower;
a very fine Essential Oyl or Balm to
the Seed, and that in great Quantity;
Oyl, Balm, Pitch, Resin and
Gum to the Bark: Besides which,
there is a Juice peculiar to each
Plant, and received in Vessels of
its own, in which a good Deal of
its Specifick Nature may consist,
(for it is not reducible to any of
those before mentioned) most of the
<i>English</i> Authors call this the proper
Juice of the Plant, but <i>Boerhave</i>
and later Writers call it the
Blood. I should digress too much
to enter into the natural History of
these several Parts of Vegetables;
my Design at present reaching no
further than with Respect to their
Assimilation into Animal Substance;
and therefore I refer to
the Authors who have expresly
treated of these Matters, and proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to examine Vegetable Juices
in another Light.</p>

<p>The Juices of Plants are Watry,
Saline, Oily, Spirituous, Gummy,
Balsamick, or Resinous, all discoverable
by Art. The Water is generally
found in the Absorbent Vessels
of Plants, but mixed with a
Proportion of Salt, which, tho’
always soluble in Water, otherwise
appears of very different Nature in
different Plants, and differs in Degree
of Volatility.</p>

<p>The Oily Part is that which
grows Fluid at the Fire, proves inflammable,
and will not unite with
Water, without the Intervention of
Salt. It is seldom obtained pure
from Vegetables, because therein
it exerts so very strong an attractive
Force upon Salt, Water, and Earth,
that nothing less than the Force of
Fire, assisted by the Action of the
Air, can separate them, as appears
in <i>Helmont’s</i> Everlasting Coal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spirituous Parts of Plants,
or those which contain the Odour
and Taste, are very volatile, will
mix with Water, and sometimes
burn in the Fire, the Oyl of the
Vegetable being here greatly attenuated,
broke, and subtilized; as
appears by its being exhalable by
the Heat of the Summer Sun, so as
to form the particular Atmosphere
of the Plant, and fill the Air with
Particles that affect our Senses even
at some Distance.</p>

<p>Gums are such Productions of
Vegetables, as will mix with Water,
dissolve over the Fire, and burn
away, being tough viscid Substances,
and contain a large Proportion
of the Oyl and Salt of the Plant.
Balsams are native Oyl of Vegetables,
brought to a thick Consistence,
but containing a large Proportion
of an acid Spirit and Salt:
However, they differ greatly from
the Oyls they afford. Lastly, Resins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
are such Productions of Vegetables,
as being hard and dry, prove
brittle in the Cold, soluble by Heat,
inflammable and misceable with
Oyl, but not with Water.</p>

<p>It would be endless to give an
Account of the particular Qualities
of the proper Juices of Plants; since
these differ in different Plants, and
many Times in different Parts of
the same Plant. There is a much
greater Variety in Vegetable than in
Animal Nature; and a much greater
Difference in the Juices of one
than of the other; for the Number
of different Plants known and used
very much exceeds the Number of
different Animals known and used;
and particular Plants have greater
Variety of Juices than particular
Animals; whose Juices (if I may
so speak) are more homogenial than
those of Plants. This will appear
more evidently by comparing what
hath been here said, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Consideration of Animal Substances
with Regard to Diet.</p>

<p>I have hitherto considered Vegetables
in their natural State, but
before we can apply what hath
been laid down to Animal Diet, we
must consider some Changes many
of them undergo, before they are
used. The Chief of these happens
by Fermentation, the Effects
of which upon Vegetables deserve
to be considered; since Bread, Wine,
and Malt Liquors, so great a Part
of our common Food, are prepared
from Vegetables that have gone
thro’ this Operation, or are mixed
with Ferments in their Preparation.</p>

<p>Fermentation is a Change in Vegetables
by Means of some intestine
Motion, the Effect whereof is, that
in Distillation there arises a volatile
inflammable Liquor, capable of mixing
with Water, commonly called
Spirits; or if the Fermentation be
so managed as to produce Vinegar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thence arises in Distillation a watry,
thin, acid Liquor, capable of extinguishing
Fire. I have here only
mentioned the Effects of Fermentation;
what this intestine Motion
is, or its Cause, I do not pretend to
describe, because I do not know it:
Its Effects are very well known to
be either a vinous or an acetous Liquor,
and they are producible from
all Vegetables, and from Vegetables
only; for all the Art yet known
will never gain such Spirits either
from Fossils or Animals: Putrefaction,
Digestion, and Effervescence
are all done by intestine Motions,
but will neither produce Wine nor
Vinegar; so that in this Light Fermentation
is confined to Vegetables.</p>

<p>It needs no very deep Enquiry
into the History of Fermentation,
to know, that in Wine (by which
Name I understand all fermented
Vegetable Liquor, Ale, Beer, Mead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and all artificial Wines, as well as
that made from the Grape) the Spirituous
Parts of the Vegetable are so
volatilized and loosened, that very
small Heat raises them from the
other Parts of the Liquor, even
many fly off upon being exposed to
the Air: The viscid, oily, and glutinous
Parts of Vegetables are so
broke and separated, and the Spheres
of their mutual Attractions so diversified,
that they are no longer
retained. Before Fermentation, the
longer you boil the Decoction of
any Vegetable, its oily and spirituous
Parts are more concentrated,
and little besides Water, and some
essential Oyl goes away; after Fermentation
the Spirit goes away,
and the Water remains: This is
commonly known to Brewers and
Distillers.</p>

<p>What is next observable in this
Change is, that the essential Salt is
thrown from the Body of the Liquor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thus fermented, and adheres
to the Side of the Vessel wherein
the Liquor is deposited, and crystallizes
into Tartar. In Vinegar
this Salt is kept in the Mass of the
Fluid (the Oyl being thrown off)
where uniting with the aqueous
and spirituous Parts, it turns sowre,
and becomes Vinegar by Means of
that Fermentation. After this no
Tartar can be generated from it, nor
any inflammable Spirit obtained;
but on the contrary, a watry, poor,
acid Liquor, capable of extinguishing
Fire, rises first from the Still.
In Wine, the volatile Salt and Oyl
of the Vegetable are attenuated and
reduced into one Spirit; Vinegar
is the essential Salt of Wine made
more acid by a new Fermentation,
and intimately mixed with the watry
and spirituous Parts of the same.</p>

<p>The Spirit produced from the
Distillation of Wine is a Liquor of
such active Parts, and capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
effecting such Changes in animal
Bodies, that it ought to be retained
entirely to Medicine; but since it
is too much used in Diet, it may
be proper to remember it under
that Head.</p>

<p>I must take Notice of one other
Change in Vegetables, and that is
what they undergo by Putrefaction,
because it Approaches somewhat to
animal Digestion, and gives us
some Sort of Notion of the Manner
of converting vegetable into animal
Substances.</p>

<p>It is very well known, that if a
Quantity of green recent Vegetables
be heaped up together, and
pressed down, they will in a little
Time begin to heat in the Middle,
and in the Course of eight or
ten Days will have passed by Degrees
to a violent Heat, so as sometimes
to flame and burn away;
this Mass acquires a putrid, cadaverous,
feculent Taste and Smell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and turns into a soft, pappy Substance,
resembling human Excrement
in Scent, and putrified Flesh
in Taste; and by all the Tryals
that can be made, gives us no mark
of vegetable Substance, but is entirely
turned into an animal one:
For upon Distillation it yields a
Water of an urinous Scent; a white,
volatile, dry, alkaline Salt; a volatile,
alkaline, oily Salt; and a thick
fetid Oyl, all the same that are
producible from animal Substances;
and lastly, (which is the nicest Criterion
between vegetable and animal
Substances) if the Remainder
be calcined in an open Fire, it will
not yield the least Particle of fixed
Salt, which all Vegetables whatsoever
are known to do.</p>

<p>All Vegetables whatever are subject
to this Putrefaction (and indeed
Animals too) and all specifick Differences
are destroyed by it: It is
evidently caused by Fire itself collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
or included within the subject;
and seems to be a general
Law of Nature, wisely established,
to produce wonderful Changes in
the World, and to prevent the Indolence
of Matter; this active Principle
or Medium giving an easy
and reciprocal Transition of vegetable
into animal Substances, and
of animal into vegetable. I think
it cannot be out of the Way here to
observe, that the Change which the
Aliment suffers in the human Body,
is in some Measure reducible to
this; for if a Man should live entirely
upon acid Vegetables, acid
Bread, and Fruits, drink Rhenish
Wine, no Part of his Body or Juices
would, upon Distillation, or other
Tryal, yield the least Portion of an
acid or fixed Salt, but constantly a
volatile Alkali. There cannot indeed
be supposed any perfect Putrefaction
in the Bodies of Animals;
for so soon as any Thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
contained therein tends this Way,
it is discharged as Excrement; all
the Acids of the Aliment are subdued
by the vital Powers of Animals,
and converted into volatile
Salts of an alkaline Nature; without
an actual or real Putrefaction,
yet by an Operation nearly approaching
thereto: If these Salts
were not discharged, before Putrefaction
(as by examining the Excrement
it appears they are) they must
produce such terrible Effects as
would immediately destroy the
Animal.</p>

<p>In examining vegetable Substances
as Food, we must consider them
as eaten Raw, as prepared by the
Arts of Cookery, and as subjected
to Fermentation. In the first Case
they are sometimes the Food of
Men, always of Animals that we
feed upon; in the others the Food
of Men alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Raw Vegetables that become
Parts of Animals, are bruised, ground,
and comminuted by the proper
animal Organs, and mixed with
animal Juices in their Passage. By
this Means their Juices are expressed;
such of them as are capable of mixing
with Water naturally, or by the intermediate
Assistance of the Bile,
are formed into one common fluid
Mass or Chyle, which constitutes
the first Nourishment of Animals;
whence the Blood, Serum, Lymph,
and other animal Juices are formed.
From what was said before,
this appears to be the Water, impregnated
with the essential Salt,
the Spirit, some Portion of its essential
Oyls, mixed with the Water
by Means of the Salt and the Bile;
these by the vital Powers are formed
into a white Liquor, which is the
Chyle, not unfitly represented in
the common making of Emulsions
from oily Seeds. The Chyle still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
retains its vegetable Nature, and
somewhat specifick to the Vegetable
it came from; but when it hath
been circulated several Times thro’
the Body, and thoroughly mixed
with the Juices thereof, it acquires
animal Properties; vegetable and
animal Juices are pretty near of
the same specifick Gravity, and
consequently fit to repair each
other; the different Impulses of
Heat and Motion, with due Mixture,
create the Difference; though
this will always hold true, that
an animal Body constantly repaired
from vegetable Juices, cannot
have so strong a tendency to a putrescent
alkaline State, as a Body
constantly repaired from animal
Juices, already disposed to that
State.</p>

<p>The common Effects of the Art
of Cookery upon Vegetables, will
be understood by what happens in
the Decoction of Plants. In boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
any Plant, its most sublime fluid
Part flies off, and indeed it is incapable
of bearing a greater Heat than
that of the Summer Sun, the Salts
of the Plant are dissolved in the
Water, and its thicker and grosser
Oyl rises to the Top, like a fat
Scum; so long as the Plant retains
any Taste or Odour, change the
Water as often as you please, there
will constantly arise a fat, odorous,
viscous, inflammable and frothy
Matter, which can be no other than
the Oyl of the Plant loosened from
the Salts. In Proportion then, as
the Salts are dissolved in the boiling
Water, the Oyl attenuated, as it
must be before it can be so far specifically
lighter as to arise to the
Top, we are to judge how far the
Art of Cookery is serviceable in the
Preparation of vegetable Diet.</p>

<p>From what was said before in
relation to Fermentation, it is plain
that the vegetable Oyls are much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
volatilized, rendred more active,
and separated from the Salts; upon
this Account it is, that they are endowed
with an inebriating Quality,
which is confined entirely to Wines,
for no other Substance hath that
Quality. No one was ever drunk
with eating Grapes, or drinking
Must or Wort before Fermentation.
The stupifying Quality of Poppy,
Henbane, Mandrakes, Nightshade,
and other Plants of that Class, is
very different from the Effects of
Wine or its Spirit. The chief Effect
of Fermentation, in Regard to
Diet, is supposed to consist in rendring
vegetable Substance less difficult
to be overcome by the Action
of animal Organs and Mixtures, and
easier to the digestive Powers; but
there are other good Effects not so
commonly thought of; fermented
vegetable Substance is very little
subject to Putrefaction, and is a
great Preservative against it. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the styptick Power that the Spirit is
endowed with, the Tone of the Fibres
is increased in Digestion, their
Force enlarged, and consequently
their Action greater upon the vegetable
Parts, and a larger Quantity of
animal Juices mixed with them;
and it is no difficult Matter to imagine,
that the inward Heat of an
human Body should draw forth
the Spirit of fermented Liquors.</p>

<p>The Parts of Vegetables most
used in Food, are the Seeds of
Plants, our common Bread and
Drink being made from them:
These, by what was said before,
contain the most elaborated Juices,
the greatest Quantity of fine Oyl
and Spirit, and are consequently
most fit for Nourishment; several
Fruits are eaten Raw, because their
Juices are concocted to the utmost
Degree of Perfection, and contain,
in greatest Quantity, the finest and
most elaborated vegetable Oyl, mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with the essential Salts peculiar
to each, which would be lost in Decoction:
But the coarser Parts of
Vegetables, as Roots, Leaves, Stalks,
unripe Fruits, and Flowers, require
the Arts of Cookery to be exercised
upon them, to render them more
easily subject to the animal Powers,
and assimilable to their Juices.</p>

<p>I design not to enter into the several
specifick Differences of Vegetables,
I hope I have said enough
to explain their general Nature,
and how they become reducible
into animal Substances; I shall next
consider these Substances in the
same Manner.</p>

<p>By all the Tryals yet made upon
animal Substances, they are resoluble
into the same Parts with Vegetables,
only differently modified;
that is, as we saw before, Water,
Earth, Salt and Oyl, the specifick
Spirit being no other than Water
impregnated with the specifick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
highest rectified Oyl and Salt, the
Water and Earth in both are individually
the same; and though
there be good Reason to imagine,
that there is originally but one
Oyl in Nature, and that the fixt
Salt of Vegetables, and the volatile
Salt of Animals, may be originally
the same, since transmutable into
one another; yet it is necessary to
examine these two Principles in animal
Substances, that by comparing
them with what we before discovered
in Vegetables, we may have
some Notion of their Differences
with Regard to their Use in Diet.</p>

<p>The great Excess of animal Heat
and Motion, beyond what is necessary
to Vegetables, the stronger and
quicker Circulation of their Juices,
necessarily require and occasion
that the Oyls and Salts in animal
Bodies should be differently modified
from what they are in Vegetables.
No Motion is performed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Animals without some Portion of
Oyl, and perhaps Water too, to lubricate
the Parts, and keep them
supple; the Attrition would cause
great Mischief, make the Motion
uneasy, wear away and burn up the
Parts, if they were not softned and
moistned by an oily Fluid; and
accordingly we find all the Muscles,
Tendons, Joints and other
Parts employ’d in Motion, to have
Repositories of this Oyl placed about
them, and that so artificially,
that the Very Motion occasions the
Diffusion of this Oyl upon them.
There is an innate Principle of Heat
or Fire, that attends the vital Powers,
that may very well occasion the
Change and Volatilization of Salts
in animal Substances, in the same
Manner as was before observed in
the Putrefaction of Vegetables.</p>

<p>Animal Oyls differ according to
the Principles inherent in them,
for when freed from Earth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Salts (which is very difficult by Reason
of their mutual Attractions under
certain Circumstances) they appear
to be simple and unactive, and
the same in all animal Bodies.</p>

<p>By this Account then we are
principally to regard the different
Quantities and Degree of Volatility
in these Salts, and the Degree of
Consistence or Impregnation of
animal Oyls with them. It must
be observed, that the Salts in the
Bodies of living Animals are not
perfectly the same they appear to
be, when extracted thence by chymical
Resolutions; a great Alteration
is made by the Fire, and a good
deal by the Tendency all animal
Substances have to Putrefaction, upon
a Stagnation of their fluid Parts:
Even in the Evaporation of human
Blood (fresh drawn) by a gentle
Fire, this Salt, though not perfectly
fixed, will not rise, but only the Spirit:
These Salts are of a mild attenuating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Nature in healthy Bodies,
whose vital Powers are sufficient to
subdue the Substances they feed upon:
But in such as have not that
vital Power in that Degree, or commit
Errors in Diet, where these Salts
are not sufficiently attenuated, or
the first Digestion stronger than the
concoctive Powers or the Discharges,
these Salts acquire Properties
productive of many acute and
chronical Diseases; (not within
the Compass of this Enquiry) these
may be prevented, and sometimes
cured, by a strict Application to
Diet, proper to correct the different
Modifications of these Oyls and
Salts.</p>

<p>I own it is pretty Difficult to determine
the exact Degree of Volatility
these Salts acquire in any
particular Animal, or in different
Parts of the same Animal; yet
there are very evident Marks of a
Defect, or Exceeding in the Volatility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of these Salts, by examining the Discharges
from Animals, by a greater
or less Tendency to Putrefaction,
by several Distempers more especially
incident to human Bodies, and
other Methods of Art to be met
with in the History of Physick.</p>

<p>From what was said before, it is
evident that an Animal, whose Juices
are supplied from animal Juices,
hath a more alkalescent Tendency
than an Animal supplied
with vegetable Juices; that is, the
Salts are more highly volatilized,
and impregnate the Oyls, Water,
and other Fluids in a stronger Manner,
and in greater Quantities; and
in Fact, we find the Substance of such
animal Bodies, as are fed upon Animals,
or Use stronger Exercise, are
more liable to Putrefaction, than
the Substance of Animals that feed
upon Vegetables, and are more
slothful. Fish, Foxes, Hawks, Venison,
Horses, have their Substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
more liable to Putrefaction, and discover
to our Senses more exalted
Salts and Oyls, than tame Fowl,
Sheep, and Oxen; the Juices of
poisonous Animals have them still
more exalted, as in the Viper.</p>

<p>Animal Substances being already
assimilated, are more easily transmutable
into other Animals, and
therefore more nourishing than Vegetables;
accordingly we find such
Animals as are nourished by animal
Food, to be more couragious,
robust, active, bold, strong, than
those which are nourished by Vegetables
only. And even in Men,
who have proper Organs for digesting
both animal and vegetable
Food, and consequently by Nature
designed to use both, we find a remarkable
Difference according to
their Diet. The Inhabitants of fishing
Towns, who may well be supposed
to feed thereon, are strong, nervous
and prolifick; and their Discharges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
especially their Sweat, are
often attended with a very strong
rancid Smell. The Difference between
these People, and some poor
Peasants in the Country, who have
no other than vegetable Food, is too
obvious to mention.</p>

<p>As to the Preparation of animal
Diet, by the Arts of Cookery, for
Use, it is needless to repeat what
was before said under this Head in
relation to Vegetables, the Manner
being pretty much the same. I
shall only just observe, that in boiling,
the Salts and a good Portion of
Oyl is dissolved, and attenuated in
the Decoction, which makes the Decoction
it self very nourishing;
the animal Substance it self is much
relaxed and softned, so that it may
almost all be reduced to a Jelly
or thick Oyl; by roasting, the
Salts are more brought into Action,
and the fluid Parts lessened; so that
what remains is more highly impregnated
therewith; in baking no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Part evaporates, but both Salts and
Oyls are loosened and exalted by
the Heat in the Oven; these Differences
are observable by the Taste,
affect the digestive Powers in different
Degrees, and are usefully attended
to, in many different Habits
of the human Body, too tedious now
to be enumerated.</p>

<p>It is to be observed here (as before
concerning Vegetables) that the
nearer the nutritious Juices are to
their Roots, the more they partake
of the Nature of their Origine; but
the more they are mixed with animal
Juices, and the greater Number
of animal Circulations they pass
through, the more they acquire an
animal Nature. The Chyle in Animals
feeding upon Vegetables is
Acid, and generally speaking it is so
in Men, because their Diet is more
so than otherwise. The Milk is less
Acid than the Chyle, but turns perfectly
so by standing. In the Blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
this Tendency is lost, and the Salts
from fixed become volatile. But
there are Juices in animal Bodies,
that have Salts of a much higher
Degree of Volatility than the Blood,
but when they arrive at too high a
state of Alkalescence, they are discharged
generally by Urine, or some
other Excretion.</p>

<p>I do not here pretend to account
for these Facts; that they are such
is beyond Controversy, and I think it
very agreeable to the Order of Nature,
that they should depend upon
some general Cause: If the Principle
of Attraction be one, and from
what Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i> hath delivered
in his Opticks it bids very fair
for it, though that great Philosopher
was either too modest, or too
knowing, to propose it as such,
otherwise than by way of Quære;
if the Principle of Attraction be an
universal Cause in such Effects as
we have been speaking of, may it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
very justly be supposed, that when animal
Decoctions turn sowre by standing,
and so far put on a vegetable
Nature, as to differ from the Course
animal Substances take, when left
to themselves, that the Salts are disunited,
and put from the Sphere
of one anothers mutual Attraction,
so as perhaps to exert a repelling
Power; and may not the same
thing happen, when putrified animal
Substance becomes Nourishment
for vegetable Bodies, their
Salts being disunited, and their mutual
Attractions dissolved or overcome
by the Attraction of Water,
Earth or other Parts, in the Substance
which I before called vegetable
Chyle? When Vegetables by Putrefaction
acquire an animal Nature,
are not the Salts brought into
their Spheres of Attraction, so as to
form different intestine Motions
thereby, and to produce Heat, Fire,
fetid Vapours, and Putrefaction?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>, Opt. p. 362.
compares a Particle of Salt to a
Chaos, dense, hard, dry, and earthy
in the Center; and rare, soft, moist
and watry in the Circumference,
and hence, says he, it seems to be
that Salts are of a lasting Nature, being
scarce destroyed unless by drawing
away their watry Parts by Violence,
or by letting them soak into
the Pores of the central Earth, by a
gentle Heat in Putrefaction, until
the Earth be dissolved by the Water,
and separated into smaller Particles,
which by Reason of their smallness
make the rotten Compound appear
of a black Colour. Hence also it
may be that the Parts of Animals
and Vegetables preserve their several
Forms, and assimilate their Nourishment;
the soft and moist Nourishment
easily changing its Texture
by a gentle Heat and Motion,
till it becomes like the dense, hard,
dry, and durable Earth in the Center<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of each Particle. But when the
Nourishment grows unfit to be
assimilated, or the central Earth
grows too feeble to assimilate it, the
Motion ends in Confusion, Putrefaction
and Death.</p>

<p>There is one animal Juice which deserves
to be more particularly considered,
not only because it is more used
in our Food, than any other, but
because it seems to partake of that
just Medium between animal and
vegetable Substances so desirable in
our Diet, and that is Milk. It is
neither Acid nor Alkaline; it seems
to have enough of the animal Nature,
to give strong and perfect
Nourishment to animal Bodies, and
to be easily assimilable to their Substance;
enough of the Vegetable
to prevent too strong a Tendency
to a volatile Alkali; being a kind
of Emulsion, or white, oily animal
Liquor, prepared originally from
Vegetables, and from which all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Parts of animal Bodies may receive
their Nourishment and Growth.
Many Persons have lived entirely
upon Milk; and the Body of a
Child may, at the End of some
Months after its Birth, be considered
as compounded of the Milk of
its Nurse; the Parts it brought into
the World being changed for
others, supplied by the Nourishment.</p>

<p>Tho’ Milk be of it self neither
Acid nor Alkaline, it may not be
amiss to take Notice of the Changes
it undergoes upon being mixed with
either, because hence we may determine
its Agreement or Disagreement
with different Constitutions.
If Milk be mixed with Acids it coagulates
into a Curd; if mixed
with Alkalies, upon Heat it turns
Yellow, then Red, and at length to
a very deep dark Red, and by long
continuance Black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Milk taken from Animals that
feed upon Vegetables, if suffered to
stand in a clean glass Vessel, will of
it self separate into two Parts; the
lighter, and more oily, rising to the
Top in the Form of Cream; both
which in a few Days turn sowre,
and at the End of ten or twelve
Days, acquire a very considerable
Degree of Acidity; but if the Animal
it be taken from feed upon animal
Diet, or have fasted too long,
or be feverish, or use strong Exercise;
it will in these Cases have a
brackish or saline Taste, which is a
strong Evidence of its Tendency to
Putrefaction, and accordingly instead
of turning sowre, it will turn
rancid, and run into an Ichor.</p>

<p>It may fairly be concluded from
hence, that Milk is not proper Food
in acid Constitutions; for if Milk,
upon the Mixture of Acids, turn into
Curds and Whey, it is reasonable
to expect, that if it be taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Persons whose Bodies abound with
Acids, it shall be separated into a
thin serous Fluid, and a strong Coagulum;
which turning grumous,
may cause Obstructions in the <i>Viscera</i>,
while it ceases to be mixed and
diluted with the <i>Serum</i>, which instead
of performing that Office,
may go off in the Discharges of the
Skin, or of Urine, leaving the Body
pale, faint and weak; and hence
may arise many chronical Distempers,
foreign to our Purpose to enumerate.</p>

<p>The Change of Colour in Milk,
by Alkalies, from White to Red,
gives a very evident Reason for the
easy Transmutation of the Chyle
into Blood, when it leaves its vegetable
Nature, and puts on an Animal
one; and is a further Confirmation
of the Doctrine hitherto laid
down. The Appearances that are
observable in the Changes Milk undergoes,
when left to itself, instruct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
us in the Choice of such kind as is
most proper for Nourishment;
which is principally to be regarded,
where the Animal is entirely fed
with Milk, which is the Case of
Children at the Breast; and what
happens to Children, may with proper
Allowances be applied to older
Bodies. If a Nurse feed entirely
upon Flesh Meats, Fish, and Broths,
or be hot and feverish, or use much
or violent Exercise, some of which often
happen to be the Case in wealthy
Families, the Milk grows Yellowish,
and by standing will turn rancid,
the Child manifests an Aversion to
it, and becomes hot, red, and feverish;
on the contrary, if the Nurses
Food be too much enclined to
Acidity, which is often the Case of
poor People, the Child shall be subject
to Flatulencies, preternatural
Distention of the Body, and paleness
of the Flesh: The Milk for Food
ought to be perfectly white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
clear, the Animal that gives it, not
suffered to fast long before, and used
for Food as soon as possible after
it is milked; for thus it is had
in its most perfect and natural State.</p>

<p>Before I leave the History of Diet,
I cannot but take Notice, that as
much Irregularity is committed in
the Quantity, and Time of taking
our Food, as in the Qualities or
Properties thereof. From what
hath been said it appears, that true
Nutrition consists in the proper Assimilation
of the Food to the Vegetable,
or animal Body that takes
it in; if the Powers of the Body be
sufficient to assimilate what it takes
in in a proper Manner, and to throw
forth what it doth not need, or
what is unfit for Assimilation, let
the Food be what it will, the Body
will be well nourished; on the contrary,
if what be taken in be too
strong to be changed by the digestive
Powers, or the Powers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Body too weak to expell it, that Body
must be changed to a bad Habit;
which, in its utmost Degree,
is the Case of Plants and Animals
that are poisoned. If the Body be
oppressed with Loads of the most
proper Food, more than the digestive
Powers are able to deal with,
or than there are animal juices sufficient
to mix with for the proper
Assimilation; those Powers must be
weakened, the Fibres, being stretched
beyond their Tone, lose of their
Force, and what Foods are taken
in, not being sufficiently acted upon
by the Solids or Fluids of the
Body, take the Course they would
naturally have done out of the Body,
and turn to Corruption, and
Humour. When this happens to
be the Case in human Bodies, upon
a Stoppage of any of the great Discharges,
as of Perspiration, by taking
Cold, they become Subject to
Fevers, and other acute Diseases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and Obstructions of the tender Bowels,
chiefly the Liver and Lungs,
which bring on several chronical
Diseases, more especially the Dropsy
and Asthma; for it is observable,
that all overfed Animals have
large Livers subject to Putrefaction,
and are short winded.</p>

<p>I know no exact Way of determining
the Quantities of our Food,
and of the Changes inducible upon
the Body, by the Quantities only,
(before Pain and Sickness teach the
Exceeding, when perhaps it may
be past Remedy) but the Balance,
and yet a Man would run the Hazard
of being turned into Ridicule,
that should gravely talk to People
of weighing their Food or their Bodies,
at certain Times. The cravings
of Nature, and the returns of
Appetite are thought to be better
Indications for a supply, than the
Weight of the Body, and so indeed
they would be, if left to themselves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
but we eat without Hunger, drink
without Thirst, and lie a bed at
times unnatural to sleep. I need
not add that these are the People
that want most the Helps of Medicine.
The Quantities of Food, and
the unnatural Encrease of the Body
may be attended to, without running
into ridiculous Extreams of
nicety; and after the Rules are once
settled, these things may be known
without living in a Pair of Scales
with <i>Sanctorius</i>. I can affirm it
from certain Experience, that the
keeping the Body to a certain standard
of Weight, is a great preservative
of Health; and many acute,
and chronical Diseases may be foreseen,
and prevented by it, and this
is known by weighing once or twice
a Month with less trouble than paring
ones Nails, and regulating the
Quantity of Food accordingly; so
true is the Aphorism of <i>Sanctorius</i>,
that if such Kinds, and such Quantities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
be daily added to the Body as
go off, and the Exceedings discharged,
lost Health will be recovered,
and present Health preserved.</p>

<p>Among the chronical Distempers,
which owe their Origine to irregularities
in Diet, the Gout is neither
the least considerable nor frequent;
though perhaps the best and least
dangerous Way of clearing the
Blood of the morbid Matter; for it
naturally tends to the Extreams, and
is generally so great a Tyrant, that
it will suffer no other Distemper
to rage but itself; upon this Account
it is that People wish for,
and are complimented upon the
Gout, as an Indication of the vital
Powers being in such Strength
and Vigour, as to drive forth the
gouty Matter; and it is no wonder
that Persons should wish such
active, fiery Particles, as the gouty
Matter seems to consist of, fixed
to a certain Joint, and expelled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Body, when they are floating
through the Mass of Juices, and
disorder the whole Machine, which
is often the Case of gouty Persons
before it fixes: The gouty Salts (if
they be Salts, as most probably they
are) appear to be active, sharp, pungent,
fiery Principles, and when, by
the Force and Heat of the Body,
they are brought into Action, are
not improperly termed concentrated
Fire it self; and indeed the Effects
of their Action manifest something
not very different therefrom,
by calcining the animal Substance
into Chalk or Lime, or somewhat
approaching thereto, in the Knots
of gouty Joints: Their Volatility
may Occasion their being more easily
brought into a State of Action,
but at the same Time makes their
Expulsion out of the Body quicker
and easier. A fit of the Gout is no
other than an attempt of Nature to
collect and expell these Salts out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the Body, which, if successfully performed,
leaves the Person free from
the Gout, till such Time as from
the natural Course of the Food, or
other Causes, the Blood and Juices
become again overcharged with
gouty Matter, to such Degree, that
Nature attempts the same Way of
Relief it before experienced, and
occasions another Fit.</p>

<p>From this Account it appears,
that if any thing be to be done during
the Time of a Fit, which is the
Season many Persons very preposterously
attend a Cure, it can only be
by supporting the Powers of the
Body, to enable Nature, to go on
with its Work: (For it must be considered,
that the Symptoms of Pain
arise from the Action of the Body
in that Work, as well as from the
Action of the gouty Salts;) and by
promoting the natural Discharges
from the Part affected, by gentle
heat and Warmth; all external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Applications, foreign to these Ends, are
useless, and generally speaking dangerous.
Indeed if any thing may
safely be applied in this Case, for
these Ends, some Preparation of the
Poppy seems to me to be the most
promising, and least hazardous.
This Plant is endowed with Powers
that soften and attenuate in a great
Degree, gently promote and encrease
the Motion of the Juices, and
occasion in Bodies properly disposed,
as great, if not greater Discharges
by the Skin, than any other Medicine
yet discovered. If we add
to this its particular Property of easing
Pain, may we not justly form
great Expectations from it? Its
Virtues given inwardly, in the Case
we are speaking of, have been long
known and experienced; its outward
Application hath not, that I
know of, been mentioned before;
and I would be understood
now rather to mention it, than recommend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it. I have tried it in about
half a Dozen Persons, the better
half of which found immediate and
wonderful Relief from it, and those
who did not, found no inconvenience,
to my thinking, chargeable upon
the Medicine; though perhaps
I am fond enough, like other Patrons
of new Tryals, to impute the
want of Success to other Causes,
than to a Deficiency in the Medicine;
I only mention the thing, not
being thoroughly satisfied about it,
for want of sufficient Tryal. But
thus far I may venture to assert, that
this, or any other external Applications,
are neither to be unwarily or
unskilfully ventured upon.</p>

<p>Some Authors of good Note
have recommended purging the
Bowels upon the Recess of the
Gout, and during the Intervals of
the Fit, as a proper preventive Cure
in the Gout. That keeping the
alimentary Passages clean, and in
good Order, is of Use not only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the Gout, but in several other
Distempers, is undoubtedly true;
but how far this may be attended
with a weakening of the Fibres of
the Stomach, and how far the gouty
Salts, already lodged in the Blood
and Juices, may be drawn into these
Parts, so as to act thereon, deserves
very well to be considered. The
Tendency of Nature is to drive the
gouty Humour to the Extreams,
and expell it forth of the Body; the
Tendency of purging by the Bowels,
further than cleansing the first
Passages, is to draw the gouty Humour
thither, and expell it by Siege.
The Consonancy of these Tendencies
may be seen without any Witchcraft;
but a very accurate Judgment
is necessary to distinguish at
what Time, or in what Degree, the
Juices of the Body are impregnated
with the gouty Matter, so as to determine
upon purging with Safety,
or what Progress they have made in
their Collection, and Tendency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the Joints, to venture to disturb Nature,
in her own way of discharging
them. Purging during the Time
of a Fit is always avoided even by
the Patrons of habitual gentle Purging
out of it, and a Looseness is esteemed
a very dangerous Symptom
at that Time; sure I am from Experience,
that many gouty Persons,
who have run into the Practice of
habitual Purging, even with those
Medicines that are most strengthning,
have found very bad Effects
from that Custom, have been afterwards
less able to withstand the Attacks
of the Gout, have had more
frequent and longer Returns, have
at length sooner sunk under it, and
fallen into worse Habits of Body,
than others who have avoided that
Practice: There may no doubt
be a Necessity for the Use of evacuating
Medicines, but they are always
to be exhibited upon the maturest
Consideration, and the best
Advice. People that take up such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Practices upon their own Opinions,
will in the End find cause to repent
it.</p>

<p>The best Way of curing the Gout,
(if it may be allowed that Name) is
to prevent it, that is, to hinder the
Generation of this gouty Humour
in the Body; this is to be effected
no other way, that I know of, but
by Diet: While the digestive Powers
of the Body are in such full
Strength and Vigour, as perfectly to
assimilate the Food into its own
Substance, and they be not oppressed
with greater Loads than they
are able to manage, the Choice of
particular kinds of Diet will be of
little Consequence; but these are
always defective in gouty Persons,
and these Defects are productive of
different Habits in different Constitutions,
which must be attended to
in Rules for Diet in general, as well
as in the Gout. Long Habits are not
suddenly changeable with Safety;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and after the <i>Ætas vergens</i>, the
human Body doth not freely admit
of Changes. A Body always supported
in an high Manner, with
Flesh Meats, and Wine, will not
well bear a sudden Change to a low
Diet; and on the contrary, a Body
fed upon Water and Vegetables, will
not well bear a sudden Change to
an high Diet; sudden Repletions
or Evacuation is dangerous, and
therefore <i>Celsus</i> well advises, <i>Nullum
cibi genus fugere, quo populus
utatur, interdum in convictu esse,
interdum ab eo se retrahere; modo
plus justo, modo non amplius assumere</i>,
but this is to be understood of
People in Health.</p>

<p>Milk seems to be the best Medium
of Diet, and yet from what was
before said of it, there must be many
gouty Constitutions it will not
agree with; the same may be said of
Turneps, which have been in their
Day reckoned Specifick to the Gout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
as well as Milk; and the Truth is,
that many Persons have suffered irreparable
Damage, and some lost
their Lives, by attempting particular
Diets in improper Habits of Body.
It is utterly disagreeable either
to Reason or Experience, to fix
any one general Rule of Diet that
shall agree with all Constitutions,
or even all gouty Constitutions.
The particular Constitutions of
gouty Persons are hardly reducible
to general Rules, and nothing but
Observations, and accurate Judgment,
can determine upon them so
as to direct a proper Diet. <i>Lewis
Cornaro</i>, who is one of the strongest
Instances of the force of Diet,
in the little Account he hath published,
tells us that he found several
Particularities in his own Constitution,
which his Physicians could no
way satisfy him in. One Instance
is much to our purpose, old Wine
disagreed so much with him, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in the Months of <i>July</i> and <i>August</i>,
in his later Years, he was forced to
abstain altogether from Wine, this
generally brought him to Death’s
Door every Year with perfect Weakness;
for though he had been gouty,
and cured of it by Diet, he never
refrained from Flesh Meat or Wine
in some small Quantities, nor could
he relish or digest his Food without
Wine: So soon as the Grapes began
to turn, even before they were full
Ripe, he had Wine pressed out for
himself, whence he was wonderfully
restored, in two or three Days, to
the Admiration of his Physicians,
who could not conceive, that new
Wine, before thorough Defæcation,
should have so good an Effect.
<i>Cornaro</i> describes himself, and his
own Diet very honestly; but when
he comes to give Rules for others,
leaves the Kinds of Food to its Agreement
or Disagreement to every
particular Constitution; and concludes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with this Maxim, which is undoubtedly
true with Regard to Diet
in general, That for such Persons, to
whom no kind of Food is offensive,
the Regulation of the Quantity,
and not the Quality of the Food is
principally to be attended to; in
which this Rule is always to be
strictly observed, that no greater
Quantity even of the most proper
Food, be taken at a Time, than the
Stomach is very well able to digest.</p>

<p>Having premised thus much about
the Regard to be had to particular
Constitutions, in ascertaining
a Diet in the Gout, we may very
well enquire, what Diet is most proper
to prevent the Collection of
gouty Salts in the Juices of the Body?
From what hath been already
said, and from pretty certain Experience,
we may conclude this to be
the Milk of an healthy young Animal,
fed upon Vegetables; the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
eligible is a vegetable Diet; and
if animal Diet be absolutely Necessary,
(as no doubt, some Part of it
may be to many Constitutions) the
Flesh of such Animals, as feed upon
Vegetables, is preferable to such as
feed upon other Animals. I prefer
Wines to vegetable Diet, because
all fermented Liquors are produced
from Vegetables; of these the softest
and smoothest are always to be
preferred to the harder and rougher,
though none should be used farther
than as an help to Digestion;
for Water is the Drink proper to all
Animals. To assign Reasons for
these Assertions would be only
to repeat what I have said before;
for if that be true, these evidently
follow from it.</p>

<p>But so it is, that through the Difference
of Constitutions, or different
Habits superinduced, many
cannot bear a strict Attendance upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
one kind of Food; it shall disagree
with the Body, be nauseous
to the Stomach, fail in giving proper
Nourishment, or if too strictly
persisted in, may Cure the Gout,
and bring on some other more fatal
Distemper, or bad Habit, and even
this hath been the Case of Milk it
self. It is not within the Compass
of my present Design, nor indeed,
I am afraid, within my Power to
enumerate all the several different
Constitutions of gouty Persons, and
the different Modifications of Diet
necessary for them: A Constitution
that will bear living upon Bread
and Milk, will no doubt be in an
happier Way of being cured of the
Gout, than one that cannot. But
what will not bend, must not be
broke; vegetable Food is too flatulent,
and gives too little Nourishment
to many Constitutions, who
require Food already assimilated
into animal Substance. Stomachs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
long used to Wine, require it in Digestion,
and in many Cases and gouty
Constitutions, even while a Cure is
attempting by Diet, a little Flesh
Meat must be allowed at certain
Times, and the Powers of the Body
kept up, by the Moderate use of
Wine, chusing the easiest of Digestion,
and the softest of each Kind;
taking especial Care never to overload
the digestive Powers, by too
great Quantities; which is a Rule
that will hold at all Times, and in
all Constitutions; and is of so great
Consequence, that if not attended
to, it will invalidate the Force of
any other Rules that can be given
for Diet in the Gout, or any other
Distemper.</p>

<p>The Necessity of varying from
the strict Milk-Diet, in which the
Cure of the Gout absolutely consists,
according to the Unhappiness
of particular gouty Constitutions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
must be left to the Observations of
the Patient, of the Agreement or
Disagreement he shall have experienced
of particular Kinds of Food,
to his own Body; and to the Judgment
and Advice of a skilful and
diligent Physician.</p>

any thing perfectly new: I only
propose to confirm, by fresh Experience,
what hath been long enough
known. The Method of Cure here
advanced consists in the proper Use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of Milk for a Year and upwards.
Many will perhaps wonder at my
Endeavours to revive a Method so
long known and exploded by Physicians,
as hurtful to gouty Constitutions,
and shortening the Period of
Life itself: But being fully satisfied
from Reason, and certain Experience,
that this most excellent Remedy
is the Gift of Providence, for the
Relief of Persons afflicted with this
cruel Distemper, I could not help
drawing up and communicating
my Experience and Observations for
the Relief of others.</p>

<p><i>Cornelius Celsus</i>, the celebrated
<i>Roman</i> Physician, speaking of the
Pains and Evil that gouty People
suffer, tells us of some Persons who
entirely avoided this Distemper by
a strict Adherence to the Use of
Asses Milk, and of others that by
abstaining a whole Year from the
Use of Wine and Women, were never
afterwards troubled with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Moderns, <i>John George
Grezzell</i> hath wrote a very learned
Treatise upon the Cure of the
Gout by Milk, wherein many curious
and useful Observations are delivered;
that excellent Physician
Dr. <i>James Sacks</i> hath inserted, in
the <i>German</i> Ephemeris, a Method
for the Use of Milk, communicated
to him by a noble Baron, wherein
many useful and elegant Observations,
founded upon Experiment,
are contained. The late learned
<i>Waldsmid</i> hath published a learned
Dissertation upon the Relief of gouty
Persons by Milk, wherein he agrees
with the Authors now mentioned
as to the Cure. I have lately
received a Letter from a <i>French</i>
Gentleman my Friend, who having
been for many Years afflicted in a
most terrible Manner with the Gout,
hath been now by the Use of Milk,
free for some Years. From these
Examples I had Occasion to admire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the wonderful Effects of this Diet,
and therefore advised it to many
gouty Persons here at <i>Cassell</i>, who
have all recovered a perfect State of
Health, by a strict Adherence to
the Regimen Necessary in the Use
of this Remedy: Even some whose
Limbs were before perfectly crippled,
are now able to walk and exercise.
Colonel <i>Nicholas Dumont</i>
hath experienced the Efficacy of
this Method here at <i>Cassell</i>, for his
Limbs were so entirely contracted
that he was forced to use Crutches,
but having confined himself strictly
to the Use of this Diet for an Year
and an half, he walks very well without
a Cane, and hath performed several
Journies. I have been free
from the Gout my self upwards of
an Year, notwithstanding I had
three or four Fits every Year for
Sixteen foregoing. Colonel <i>Haste</i>
hath been restored by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Means, though he hath had some
mild Returns at several Times.</p>

<p>I shall in the first Place communicate
the Letter I just now mentioned;
next I shall lay down the
Rules Necessary to be observed in
the Use of this Milk-Diet; I shall
then demonstrate from undeniable
Principles, that this Method is the
most convenient to asswage and
cure the Gout, and that no bad
Consequences can attend the Constitution,
if it be taken with the
proper Regulations. The Letter is
as Follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">To Monsieur <i>de Collet</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p>Nothing can be more agreeable
to me, than to satisfy
the Desire of my Friends afflicted
with the Gout, in communicating
the Method of Diet, by which
the Marquis <i>de Bongi</i>, <i>Mons. Chamar</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and my self were relieved from
the Gout; you will please to take
Notice, that the Milk we used was
fresh drawn from the Cow, Morning
and Evening, without other
Art than that we both eat and
supped it, as warm as we could well
bear it; my Reason for mentioning
eating and supping the Milk, is, because
as soon as we arose in the
Morning we supped a large Bowl
of warm Milk; but the Milk which
was brought us at Dinner and Supper,
we eat with fine light Bread,
cut thin and put therein; this is
all our Secret in this Matter. Persons
afflicted with the Gout may
promise themselves Relief, provided
that once a Month, during the
Course of this Diet, or at least once
in two Months, they take a gentle
Purge, which we made Use of, and
were so strict in our Regimen, that
we neither drank Wine nor, eat other
Food, than Biscuits made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
very fine Flower, Eggs, and Sugar,
and some sweet Fruits, as Strawberries
in Summer, but we chiefly avoided
Raspberries. For my own Part, I
never sweetned my Milk with Sugar,
though some Friends who were in
the same Course did, yet without
any bad Effect. The Marquis <i>de
Bongi</i> used to mix Crabs Eyes with
his Milk before Dinner, upon a Presumption,
that it would prevent any
Sourness in his Stomach, but neither
Monsieur <i>Chamar</i> or I ever used
that Remedy. When we had strictly
adhered to this Diet for a Year,
we began to hope we might eat
Fish, or indulge our Appetites in
some varieties of Food, which one
or other of us did, more or less, occasionally,
and without any bad Effects.
At the End of Nine Months
I apprehended my Stomach to be
somewhat weakened, which made
me resolve to use a Glass of Wine
after my Milk, and accordingly after
Dinner and Supper every Day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I drank one Glass of Wine, in which
I sopped a bit of Bread; this was very
delicious to me while I used it.
At length as we found the State of
our Healths to mend, we began to
eat and drink with our Friends.
This Method hath succeeded so well,
that we live hitherto in our common
Way upon Milk, yet not so
strictly, but that we dine or sup,
once, twice or thrice a Week with
our Friends in their Manner, and
return afterwards to our Milk without
Ceremony; and by the Blessing
of God we are wonderfully
well. We dont here pretend to say,
that none of us have been since afflicted
with the Gout, for the Marquiss
<i>de Bongi</i> hath had two or
three pretty sharp Fits; but both he
and I know the Difference between
having two or three Fits in nine or
ten Years, and of being perpetually
oppressed, and confined to Bed
with this cruel Distemper, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was our Case before; especially the
Marquiss <i>de Bongi</i>, who at Six and
Thirty was almost continually confined
to his Bed, deprived of the
Use of his Limbs, and the Joints of
his Hands and Feet knotted and
chalky; instead of which, he now
uses his Limbs without any Marks
of Infirmity, insomuch that any one
who had seen him in his former
bad State, and compares it with his
present, would look on him as one
raised from Death to Life. As for
Monsieur <i>Chamar</i>, and my self,
who are more advanced in Years,
considering our Age, we are mighty
well; ’tis true indeed that sometimes,
as upon Changes of Weather,
or of the Moon, we find (or at least
we fancy so) that we have some
Threatnings of Pain, especially about
those Joints where the Gout used
to ravage, but a little Exercise soon
dissipates those Apprehensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It is now Seven Years, that Monsieur
<i>Chamar</i> and I have adhered
to this Diet, in all which Time we
have neither of us been so far oppressed
by the Gout, as to be confined
to our Beds, or even to our
Chambers, so much as one whole
Day; notwithstanding before we
fell into this Method (though we
were not perpetually under actual
Fits of the Gout) we had a continued
Weakness in our Limbs, we walked
very infirmly and with difficulty,
and if we chanced to make a wrong
Step, or to slip in walking, we suffered
Extremity of Pain; our Case
is now so far altered, that we walk
as firm, as if we had never had
the Gout. I must confess indeed
that both the Marquiss and I used
the Diet for a good while, before
we perceived any manifest Change,
but afterwards our Pain diminished
by Degrees, and the Strength of our
Limbs returned. The Milk must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
be used a good while, that the natural
Temper and Vigour of the Constitution
may have Time and Leisure
to come to itself; for though
this Diet may be often used Six
Months or even Twelve before the
Patient can use his Limbs free from
Pain, yet let him not despair, for if
once he begins to gather Strength,
it will daily increase. As to Purging,
and Evacuation of the Humours,
if possible it should be done
once a Month, in the Decrease of the
Moon: I hold purging extremely
Necessary; for my own Part, it was
what I did for the first Seven or
Eight Months of this Diet constantly,
till I grew tired of it. This is
truly the Method I used, and though
I afterwards remitted, I found no
bad Consequence. The Marquiss
and I, at present, take a Bowl of
Warm Milk every Morning, but for
the Rest of the Day drink and eat
as usual. The Marquiss indeed, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the Space of Eight Years, hath had
at Times several small Fits of the
Gout, but for my self I have hardly
had any, except sometimes upon
Changes of the Weather, or of the
Moon, I have perceived a Numbness
and Weakness in my Knees and
Joints, like Threatenings of the
Gout; but I thank God, it never
confined me, and as it came on easily,
it as easily went off. The following
is the Method of purging:
<i>Take of Scammony, white Turbith,
Hermodactyls, Leaves of Sena, Sarsaparilla,
Cinamon, and Sugar, of
each one Drachm, powder them very
fine, and divide the whole into
Seven equal Parts, one of which is
a Dose, and may be taken in white
wine or a little Broth</i>. It is necessary
to purge once a Month, especially in
the Decline of the Moon. If it be
thought necessary to purge twice in
the Month, let the first Dose be taken
in the last Quarter, the second the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
last Day of the Quarter. The Day
I took Physick, I used Milk after it
as usual. When I had pursued this
Course about Seven or Eight Months,
I found my Stomach so much weakened
from the Milk, that I was forced
to take a Glass of Red Wine
every Day after Dinner, which agreed
mighty well with me, and I
have continued it ever since; so that
I am often impatient to finish my
Milk, that I may have the Pleasure
of regaling my self with a Glass of
Wine, and a bit of Bread.</p>

<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>

<p>In the foregoing Letter are contained
many useful Observations
about the Use of Milk, and its wonderful
Efficacy in the Cure of the
Gout, from uncontestable Facts, in
the Account of the Persons there
named. I shall next lay down the
Method of this Diet, by which many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Persons here at <i>Cassell</i> were relieved.
Whoever expects Benefit
by this Method, must observe the
following Rules. No one ought
to go into this Diet without having
his Body duly prepared; he must
take Care by Degrees to change his
Habit, and for the first Month to
regulate his Diet, by strictly avoiding
all Salt or smoaked Meats; Legumes,
and stale, acid or feculent
Liquors, and to eat white Meats
sparingly, with clear small Drink,
as small Beer or Barley Water, or
Decoctions of the Woods: A Glass
of <i>Moselle</i> or <i>French</i> Wine free
from Acidity, may be allowed at
Dinner, and Gruels and Broths
made of white Meats. There is a
necessary Caution to be used, that
both in Meat and Drink, the Quantity
taken be rather within the Appetite
than beyond it; for from
overloading the digestive Powers,
arise Crudities, Flatulencies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
acid Humours, which are the Origine
of many Disorders. Upon this
Account it is necessary to purge the
Bowels, two or three Times a
Month, with Tincture of Jalap,
Elixir <i>Proprietatis</i>, Rhubarb, some
of the purging Pills, as the Arthritick
or Mastich Pills; that the Viscidity
arising from indigestions may
be carried forth of the Bowels, and
the Stomach be better disposed to
receive and digest the Milk. I am
of Opinion, the first Dose should be
taken the first Day of the Month,
preparatory to this Diet, the second
after some few Weeks of this first
Regimen, and the third the last
Day of the Month; after this I advice
the taking an Ounce of Crabs-Eyes,
or prepared calcined Hartshorn,
especially if there yet remains
any Marks of Acidity in the first
Passages. This further Caution is
very absolutely Necessary, that not
only in the first Month, but in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
subsequent, all Passion, chiefly Anger
and Grief be avoided, because
of their pernicious Consequences;
more especially the Use of Women
during the whole Year.</p>

<h3>SECT. 2.</h3>

<p>All those who have other Distempers
complicated with the Gout,
as the Scurvy, Leprosy, bad Habit
of Body, Stone or Gravel, Hystericks,
the Pox, or other Distemper
arising from the Impurity of the
Blood, too great a viscidity or acrimony
of the Juices, or a known
or latent Acid in the Blood, are first
to use Absorbent, Diuretick, Sweetening
or other Medicines, proper to
their particular Distempers, till the
Acrimony or Tenacity of the Blood
and Humours be corrected, the Acid
expelled, and such complicated
Disorders overcome, and then apply
this noble Remedy of a Milk-Diet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to the Cure of the Gout alone,
from which they may certainly promise
themselves Success: But if
while the Body is ill prepared, or
full of vitiated Juices, the Milk-Diet
should be preposterously
brought into Use, they will not only
be disappointed in their hopes of
Relief, but bring certain Destruction,
and Increase of their Disorders;
as actually happened to the Count
<i>de Perlebourgh</i>, and <i>a Lubech</i> Consul
in this Neighbourhood, who having
a Complication of Distempers,
made an improper Trial of a Milk-Diet.</p>

<h3>SECT. 3.</h3>

<p>The Milk in which the Cure of
the Gout consists, ought to be excellent
in its Kind; the Animal
from whence it is taken, as described
by <i>Waldsmid</i>, should be an Heifer,
or Cow of a middle Age, of
a good Habit, either of Red or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Black Colour, (though this need
not so strictly be minded) neither
fat nor lean, nor pregnant, and kept
separate from the Bull: In Winter
fed upon good Hay, Barley, Bran
or Straw; in Summer at good Grass,
and led in a Collar like an Horse.
If any one can keep a Cow for their
own Use, it is best, and they may
more safely rely upon help from it;
but if not, the Milk as the Milkmen
sell it will do; taking Care however
that the Cow be of a good Habit,
well fed, and not too old.</p>

<h3>SECT. 4.</h3>

<p>As to the Quality and Quantity
of the Milk, it is to be observed, that
as soon as it is milked it should be
warmed, but not so as to boil it.
Let the Vessel full of Milk be put into
boiling Water, and when it is so
hot as to be conveniently supped, or
at least so warm as when it came
from the Cow, let it be taken after
the Manner of Tea or Coffee. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Times of taking ought to be, two
Pints in the Morning, some four
or Five Hours before Dinner, as
much about Noon, and as much
about Seven in the Evening; but
the Quantity cannot be exactly determined,
because the Weakness or
Strength of the Stomach must give
a Rule in this Case; or let so much
be taken as the Stomach can bear
without Inconvenience, and the Patient
may increase the Quantity
daily till he comes to about forty
Ounces. If the Stomach be weak,
he may take it in a smaller Quantity,
four or five Times a Day; if
four Times, let two of them serve
for Dinner and Supper, with some
of the finest wheaten Bread; and
a Draught of Milk may be repeated
every four Hours; if the Milk
be taken at five Times, it may be
so ordered as to let three Hours
intervene; those who are of more
robust Constitutions, may be content
with three Meals of Milk a Day;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and it will not be amiss to take every
Morning a Dose of Crabs-Eyes,
or some other absorbent Powder:
I usually take about twelve
or fourteen Ounces of Milk in the
Morning, Twenty four Ounces with
Wheat Bread at Noon, and about
Twenty Ounces at Night, half with
Bread, and the other half drank as
common Drink. Some allow the
Use of white Meats at Dinner, lessening
the Quantities by Degrees,
and making up the Deficiencies by
Food of Milk and Eggs, so that
by Degrees the Milk and Eggs are
entirely substituted in the Place of
the Flesh Meat, and then by diminishing
the Eggs daily, Milk becomes
entirely substituted for other
Food: This Method seems to me,
entirely agreeable to tender Constitutions,
and such as dont well bear
sudden Changes. Some who have
strictly adhered to Milk for fourteen
Weeks, have indulged in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Use of poached Eggs without Salt,
Barley boiled in Milk, fresh Butter
without Salt, Custard and other
Milk Foods; and in Summer, some
Kinds of Fruits, as Strawberries,
Peaches, <i>&amp;c.</i> tho’ in my Judgment
improperly, especially such
Fruits as are cold, or seem to have
a latent Acid, or such as weaken the
Bowels. On this Head it may be
observed in general, that the less
whatever be used for Food differs
in its Nature from Milk, it may be
more freely ventured upon in the
Milk-Diet; but the Prudence and
Care of the Physician is to be
relied on, according to the Diversity
of Circumstances that may happen
in different Constitutions.</p>

<h3>SECT. 5.</h3>

<p>This Diet ought to be so long
continued, until the whole gouty
Matter be discharged forth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Body, which is to be computed by
the Degree and Length of the Distemper,
and Observations upon the
Cure in others. The longer it is
continued, the more perfect Cure
is to be expected; those that are
over-run with the Distemper, are
always to use it, others for an
Year, and others for an Year and
an half; some Persons who have,
upon continuing it only for half an
Year, thought themselves perfectly
cured, and have returned too soon
to their former Method of living,
have so far exceeded, as to be
seized again with the Gout, but
returning to the Diet, have been
cured; some more prudent, have
continued the Diet for an Year,
and then returned to their ordinary
Manner of living by Degrees,
always taking about sixteen Ounces
or a Pint of Milk every Morning,
and have thus for many Years been
free. The best Time of Beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the Diet is in the Spring, and that
from the Beginning of <i>May</i>, to the
End of <i>April</i> in the succeeding
Year.</p>

<h3>SECT. 6.</h3>

<p>Some have in the Continuance of
this Diet been seized with Oppressions
and Difficulty of Breathing,
Weakness in their Limbs, Coughs
and Phlegm; but these Symptoms
either vanish of themselves, or quickly
give way to Elixir <i>Proprietatis</i>
without an Acid, Spirit of Hartshorn
succinated, <i>Sal volatile oleosum</i>,
or any of the more fixed
absorbent alkaline Medicines.</p>

<h3>SECT. 7.</h3>

<p>For those who are oppressed with
an abundance of Humours, whose
Bowels are full of Flatulencies, or
are constipated, let them once in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
every Month or Six Weeks take a
gentle Purge of Rhubarb, or of the
Arthritick Pills, or half a Scruple of
<i>Pill Ruffi</i>, or of <i>Sylvius</i> his Gum
Pills: But if the Body be open, and
the Milk passes too quickly through,
it may suffice to take twenty Grains
of Rhubarb; or if the Body be
bound, take twenty Grains of Rhubarb
in the first Draught of Milk,
drinking the rest of the Quantity
after it, or else in the Evening take
twenty Drops of the Essence of
Rhubarb with the Milk, and repeat
it as often as there may be Occasion;
but for the general, if it can
be conveniently done, the purging
Medicines should be used in the
Decrease of the Moon.</p>

<h3>SECT. 8.</h3>

<p>If the Milk should occasion a
Looseness, let it boil before it is
used, adding a Grain of Salt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
so supping it hot; if it do not succeed
the first Time, try it a second
Time, and a third; but if it doth
not do then, take a Dose of Crabs-Eyes,
<i>Unicornu fossile</i>, or <i>Terra
sigillata</i>.</p>

<h3>SECT. 9.</h3>

<p>If the Milk should heat the
Body, let a third Part of Barley
Water, made with Raisins, be added
to it; or if it occasion Thirst at any
Time, Barley Water with Raisins;
or in case of a Cough, the pectoral
Decoction may be used between
the Intervals of using the
Milk.</p>

<h3>SECT. 10.</h3>

<p>If the Stomach be weakened by
the Use of the Milk, the Patient
may be allowed Sugar Biscuits, sopped
in <i>Spanish</i>, <i>Italian</i> or <i>Burgundy</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Wine, or any other that is neither
Acid nor Foul; and if necessary,
even a Glass of those Wines:
Thus the Stomach will be fortified,
and more easily perform its Office;
if there should be a Necessity for it,
some of the warm aromatic Powders
may be brought into Use.</p>

<h3>SECT. 11.</h3>

<p>After this Diet hath been used
twelve or fourteen Months, the
Patient may begin to use Flesh Meats
of easy Digestion, avoiding sharp,
acid or salt Meats, but using such as
we mentioned before, drinking Milk
still, or small Beer well wrought,
neither stale nor turbid.</p>

<h3>SECT. 12.</h3>

<p>The Cure being thus absolutely
finished, it will be still necessary
to take every Morning a Pint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
warm Milk, and to be constantly
cautious about your Diet, avoiding
every thing acid or sharp.</p>

<h3>SECT. 13.</h3>

<p>To prevent the Milk from cruddling,
some Sugar may be mixed
with it, or even a little Salt, thus the
Acid is prevented from gathering;
but this should be done but seldom,
and upon the most urgent Necessity.</p>

<h3>SECT. 14.</h3>

<p>Though there should not follow
an immediate or sensible Change
upon the Use of the Milk for some
Time, yet the Patient ought not
to be disheartned; for if these Rules
be strictly observed, and the Patient
be otherwise in a good Habit, the
Pains will vanish by Degrees, and a
due Strength and Tone return to
the Limbs.</p>

<h2>CHAP. III.</h2>

<p>I Have now delivered the Directions
I proposed, partly from the
Authors before-mentioned, and
partly from my own Experience;
by a due Observation of which
many Persons have been perfectly
relieved from this grievous Distemper;
of which I shall give some Examples.
<i>D. Sorbait</i>, p. 741, tells us,
that he knew several Persons, by the
Use of the Milk-Diet, either perfectly
cured, or their Gout so much
overcome, that their Pains were
dwindled to nothing. <i>John Pilus</i>,
the Emperour’s Surgeon told me,
that tho’ he frequently had Fits of
the Gout, and almost lost the Use of
his Limbs, so that he was in a very
miserable Condition, yet for these
three Years past, by the Help of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Diet, he hath been perfectly free
from Pain, his Countenance is now
become fresh and healthy, he hath
had several Children, and appears
as if he were born a-new. Count
<i>Coningseck</i>, his Imperial Majesty’s
Counsellour, found the same Benefit
by this Diet; and Count <i>S. Hillario</i>
of the Emperour’s Bed-Chamber; several
others, who were almost worn
out with the Gout, grown pale and
wan, have in a manner become
young and florid again by this
Diet. The Bishop of <i>Wallendorf</i>,
tho’ quite impotent by the Gout,
was cured by Milk. Three noble
<i>French</i> Refugees, the Marquess <i>de
Bongi</i>, Monsieur <i>de Chamar</i>, and the
Counsellour <i>de Talo</i>, have been
now many Years free from the Gout,
as appears by the Letter before inserted.
I am told that a Consul, and
several others at <i>Hambourgh</i>, are
now using this Diet with Success.
A Counsellour of <i>Oldenbourgh</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Sieur <i>Van Velden</i>, hath used this
Diet this last Winter with very wonderful
Success; for tho’ he could neither
use his Hands nor Feet, he uses
both now readily and perfectly well.
A Miner here in the Neighbourhood
hath used Milk for these six Months
past with great Benefit; he was
almost a cripple, but now walks
very well to the Mines. All the
World knows that the famous Prince
of <i>Conde</i> was cured of the Gout in
<i>France</i> by Milk-Diet. There are
two Citizens of <i>Hambourgh</i>, one of
which, tho’ he hath had the Gout
fifteen Years, is well recovered by
the Use of Milk, and the Knots in
his Joints are quite wore away.
Colonel <i>Haste</i> hath used Milk for
six Months, and been free from the
Gout; and tho’ he hath left off the
Use of it, the Fits are much easier
than before. There is no Occasion
to multiply Examples; many more
may be found in <i>Sorbait</i>, <i>Sacks</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<i>Greizel</i>, <i>Waldsmid</i>, Authors already
named. I have experienced the
great Benefit of this Diet in myself;
I was so cruelly handled by this
Distemper, that I almost lost the
Use of my Limbs, and at last had a
Fit every Month or Six Weeks; I
was at the same Time violently afflicted
with the Stone, and difficulty
of Urine; but now that I have
confined myself to this Diet for an
Year and upwards, I have not only
been free from any Fit in that Time,
but the Strength of my Limbs is returned,
the Dysury is abated; and
what is wonderful, the Stone in my
Bladder is lessened and dissolving,
so that I now hope I shall get the
better of the Gout, having been in
a manner free from it an Year and
an half; I have had some Fits indeed,
but very mild ones. I take
Milk to be a Medicine beyond any
yet discovered for the Stone, since
within the Space of one Year, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Stone in my Bladder diminished an
Ounce, as I judge from the Bits I
have voided and collected in that
Time; and since I have left off the
Cure, I have not voided one Bit.
I am of Opinion, contrary to most
Physicians, that Milk doth not breed
the Stone in the Bladder, but only
a viscid kind of Phlegm in that or
any other Part.</p>

<h3>SECT. 2.</h3>

<p>These Things premised, I shall
next examine how it comes to pass
that Milk is endued with this mighty
Power; but it is necessary first
to enquire concerning the genuine
Cause of the Gout. All the Symptoms
testify the first and nearest
Cause to be some viscid, sharp Liquor,
endued with some acid or lixivial
corrosive Salt, more or less fixed;
this Salt indeed occasions such a
singular smart Pain, that it seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
be specifick. I think it not only
acid, but also somewhat austere,
from the different earthy, cheesy
Particles it contains. Hence it fixes
its sharp stiff Points in the Membranes,
Tendons and Nerves, and
more readily thickens and coagulates
the lymphatick Juices. Where
and how this Liquor that causes the
Gout is generated, I shall explain in
a few Words. First then the Stomach
and Bowels, whether from too great
an use of Wine or Women, or from
too sedentary a Life, and want of
due Exercise, or from the particular
Disposition of the stomachick Juices,
or from bad Diet, become so affected,
that by Degrees the Digestion or
Dissolution of the Food is lessened;
the Chyle thence produced, becomes
more thick and viscid than
formerly; so that this Chyle, thus
delivered into the Blood, renders its
Mass thicker, and of Consequence
the several Secretions of the Humours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as the Lymph, animal Spirits,
the mucilaginous Juices about
the Joints are more slowly performed;
thus the Stomach and Bowels
become more tainted, the stomachick
Juices and those separated by
the Glands of the Intestines become
more viscid, and the Difficulty of
Digestion is increased; Part of the
Food turns to Flatulency, and viscid
sharp Slime in the Bowels; Part of
the Chyle becomes infected with a
corrosive acid Salt thence produced,
and being again thrown into the
Blood, the Lymph and other Juices
become infected with the same acid
Salt, which gives Birth to many
Distempers. It is observable these
viscid Juices, thus stopped in their
Progress, and infected with this
noxious Salt, so as to be more liable
to an intestine than a progressive
Motion, are the most subject to
Corruption of any in the Body, and
to contract a Thickness, and Inaptitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to Motion. Such an Humour
is the Lymph, and more especially
the mucilaginous Juice separated
in the Glands of the Joints,
in order to keep them moist and
smooth for Motion. If therefore a
sufficient Quantity of these acid
Salts be brought into the Mass of
the Blood, or the Humours impregnated
with them, be lodged
about the nervous or tendinous
Membranes, and there acquire so
extraordinary a Tenacity or Sharpness,
as to be coagulated, the Gout
thence arises, as is evident both from
Reason and Experience. That this
may more evidently appear, I shall
next explain the Figure, Situation
and Structure of these Glands.</p>

<h3>SECT. 3.</h3>

<p>These Glands, as described by
Dr. <i>Havers</i> in his new Osteology,
and as they discover themselves upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Dissection, are of two Kinds;
some are small and thickly interspersed
in the Membranes of the
Joints, and with very few Exceptions
of an equal Bigness, so as to
render the Membrane perfectly
Glandulous: In some Parts of the
Membrane, in the Joints, and in
the Furrows of the Bone, these
Glands are so united as to form
very remarkable and large conglomerate
Glands. In some of the
large Joints there is but one, as in
the Hip Joint; in others, as in the
Knee, four or five; they are of a
red Colour, which is communicated
from the blood Vessels; as to their
Substance, soft and papillary, tho’
not tender and friable; they are in
their Structure Conglomerate, consisting
of divers Membranes, wove
one within another, interspersed
with small round Vesicles, which are
not only contiguous, but adhere
closely one to another, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Membranes also do. By the Pores
of these little Vesicles a mucilaginous
Liquor is strained and secerned
from the general Mass of the
arterial Blood, and thence by the
excretory Duct, with which all these
Glands are furnished, is shed into
the Interstices of all the Joints.</p>

<h3>SECT. 4.</h3>

<p>These Glands have a sufficient
Number of blood Vessels, they dont
come out of them in right Lines,
but are observed to have many Convolutions,
Windings, and Insertions;
there seems to be a very particular
Reason, from the Nature of the
Liquor to be separated, for this Obliquity
of the blood Vessels; for
since that Liquor is to be viscid and
mucilaginous, its Parts should
proceed slowly, and not without
Difficulty, through the glandulary
Pores; and therefore the Vessels are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
contorted in the Manner we see,
that the Motion of the Blood may
be retarded, and more Time and
Leizure given, both for the separating
Particles of such a Nature, and
for their Admission through the
Pores of the Glands.</p>

<h3>SECT. 5.</h3>

<p>These Glands are of different
Shapes, so as to fit the Furrows and
Cavities where they are placed;
some are long, others conical, broad
at their Base and grow narrow towards
the Top, so as to terminate
in an Edge; some have a broad
Base, and rise into a sort of Cone;
some are like little Ridges; some
like Fringe; some are broad and
pretty flat.</p>

<h3>SECT. 6.</h3>

<p>As to their Situation, they are
differently seated in the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Joints; in some they stand over-against
the very Interstice of the
Bones, and run in a little way between
them, where the Ends of the
Bones towards that Side are not
contiguous, but so formed as in their
Conjunction to make an Interstice,
and these are commonly in the
Manner of a Fringe; some are seated
in some Sinus or Cavity, others
planted upon the Membrane, which
immediately covers the Articulation:
In general they are so seated,
that they cannot be injured by a
Compression from the Bones; and
yet there is this Contrivance, that
the Bone does, either in the Inflexion
or Extension of the Joint, lightly
press upon them, so as to promote
the Excretion of the Humour, which
they separate into the Joints, when
they are moved and stand most in
need of it; and by this Means it
seems to be most plentifully supplied,
when there is occasion for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
greatest Quantity of it, and to be
proportioned to the present Exigence,
according to the State of
Rest, or the several Degrees of Motion
in the Part when it is moved.
And it is no small Security to these
Glands, against the Obstructions
which the mucilaginous Quality of
the Liquor that they separate does
naturally dispose them to, that they
are solicited, and the Liquor expressed
out of them by the Motion of
the Parts where they are seated:
The same sort of Glands are placed
about the common Membrane of
the Muscles, and about the Tendons.</p>

<h3>SECT. 7.</h3>

<p>The Liquor that is separated from
these Glands is a Mucilage, not unlike
the White of an Egg, tho’ not
always so clear and pellucid; when
pure it is very like it. In some Animals
it is of a Colour inclining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Yellow, and is composed of watry,
saline and slimy Particles; it is supposed
that the earthy Particles may
be about a two and thirtieth Part.
The Nature of this Mucilage seems
nearly to approach to that of the
<i>Serum</i> of the Blood, separated from
the grumous Part upon being exposed
to the Air, and exhibit much
the same Appearances upon Trials
by Mixture with other Bodies, only
the <i>Serum</i> is not so mucilaginous.
The <i>Serum</i> is coagulated upon being
mixed with Spirit or Oyl of
Vitriol, Spirit of Salt, Oyl of Sulphur,
and other acid Spirits. The
<i>Serum</i>, upon being held in a Spoon
over the Fire, becomes a thick Jelly,
and at length a sort of friable Glew;
on the contrary, the Mucilage grows
thinner, upon the same Application,
throws up a slight thin Film at
Top, and produces but a slight Coagulum.
After the aqueous Parts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
evaporated, there remains scarce a
thirtieth Part of the whole Mass.</p>

<h3>SECT. 8.</h3>

<p>The principal Use of this Mucilage
is to lubricate the Joints, and
to render and preserve the Extremities
of the Bones, at their Articulations,
smooth and supple, for the
easy Performance of animal Motion.
Besides this mucilaginous Liquor
from these Glands, there is an oily
medullary kind of Substance transmitted
through the very Bone into
the Cavity of the Joints: These two
Liquors are mixed by the Motion
of the Joints, the Mucilage contributes
to make the Oyl more slimy,
and the Oyl preserves the Mucilage
from stiffening into a Jelly. This
Mucilage further serves to prevent
the Extremities of the Joints from
being burnt up in the Gout. In the
same Manner the Muscles and Tendons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
are lubricated and kept in Vigour
by the Liquor supplied from
the same kind of Glands placed on
their Membranes.</p>

<h3>SECT. 9.</h3>

<p>This Mucilage is formed from the
purer Part of the Lymph and the
serous Parts of the Blood, and separated
in these Glands from the Mass
of the Blood. In order to have a
more distinct Notion of its constituent
Parts, and to know how
it comes to occasion the Gout,
the following Experiments of
Dr. <i>Havers</i> may be very properly
repeated in this Place.
He made most of the Trials both
when it was hot and when it was
cold. Vinegar dropt into it, when
it was hot, made a considerable Coagulation
with a <i>Serum</i>; it must
be observed that those Mixtures that
were made with it cold, did produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the same Effect when it was
warmed, namely a Coagulation with
Acids and Stypticks, only in an
higher Degree: And whereas the
Coagulations, which were made
when it was in one State, did only
change it into a thick Jelly without
any <i>Serum</i>, after the Manner of a
Cheese when it is newly set, as they
term it, which over the Fire afterwards
exhibited two distinct Parts,
a <i>Coagulum</i> and a Whey; in the
other, that is, when the Mucilage
was hot, the Mixtures which coagulated
it produced an harder Curd,
and a <i>Serum</i> distinct from it. By
dropping in some of the Decoction
of Galls into it, the whole turned
into a gelatinous Mass, and it was
all a Sort of <i>Coagulum</i> like a Skin,
of a whitish Colour, and so tough
as to hang all together when it was
taken up with a Needle. This
<i>Coagulum</i> or Jelly being laid in the
Sun, and dried, the Parts of it stuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
all together in one Piece, but was
very friable and easily rubbed to a
Powder, which was very much like
fine Flower. The same Effect had
the strong Infusion of Balaustia, red
Roses, Pomegranate Bark, and the
<i>Peruvian</i> Bark, although there was
some Difference in the Coagulation,
according to the different Degrees
of their Astringency. With a few
Drops of <i>Aqua Fortis</i> distilled upon
it, the Mucilage was immediately
coagulated, though the <i>Coagulum</i>,
which was white, was so tender,
that it would by Agitation be dissolved
in fair Water, and make it of
the same Colour almost like Milk;
Spirit of Nitre made exactly the
same Alteration in it as <i>Aqua Fortis</i>
did, a <i>Coagulum</i> which was of a
white Colour. Vinegar, Spirit of
Salt of Vitriol, Oyl of Vitriol, and
of Sulphur in some Mucilage which
I tried it with, did not make any
considerable Alteration when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
cold, but in some other it did more;
when <i>Aqua Fortis</i> and Spirit of Nitre
did produce in all the same Effects
in the same Degree. It was mighty
observable, that so strong an Acid as
Oyl of Vitriol should have no greater
Effect upon it to alter it not, so
considerable as that of Vinegar,
which would incline one to think
that it is not always the high Degree
of Acidity that works this Change.
But there seems to be something
particular in Wines, which disposes
them to coagulate this Liquor, when
any of them are made Use of; and
those Parts of them, which are apt
to act thus upon it, are cast into
those Interstices where they have the
Mucilage singly to work upon. And
therefore we find how readily any
Wines do procure the Paroxysms of
the Gout, where the Tone of the
Glands is weakned, and the Patient
hath a Disposition to this Distemper;
which agrees with those Trials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I have made with some of them:
For Claret, white Wine, and even
Sack, but the Claret especially, did
make a <i>Coagulum</i> like a Jelly; and
it was not strange that Claret, which
hath both an Acid and a Stypticity
in it, should produce the greatest
Coagulation. A mercurial Water
made of Sublimate and <i>Aqua Calcis</i>,
made a very considerable whitish
Coagulation, and rendred it all
a thick Jelly, which being held over
the Fire, turned to a Curd and a
<i>Serum</i>. A Solution of <i>Roman</i> Vitriol
produced a Coagulation likewise;
so did Allum dissolved in
Water, but it made a greater Alteration
in some than it did in others,
though the Mucilages were taken
from subjects of the same Species.
<i>Saccharum Saturni</i> did inspissate it,
which appeared to be a true Coagulation,
because with the Fire they
would turn to a distinct <i>Coagulum</i>
and <i>Serum</i>. Salt of Wormwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
made no sensible Alteration, only
it seemed a little thicker, to which
I put some of the Decoction of
Galls, which immediately produced
a Coagulation. Upon dropping
in some Spirit of Vitriol, to
see what would be the Effect of the
Colluctation of the Salt and Spirit,
and I found, after it was over, that
the <i>Coagulum</i> and the serous Part
were distinguished, and the <i>Serum</i>
limpid like Water. I took some of
the Decoction of Galls, and added
to it Spirit of Vitriol, intending to
make a strong Acid austere, where
I observed that these two by themselves
produced a strong Coagulation;
and stirring of them together,
to see if the whole might not be
brought to mix by that Means, I
found the <i>Coagulum</i> turned into a
viscous Body, and a perfect soft
Gum. Then I took out the Gum,
and poured some Mucilage to the
residuous Liquor, by which it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
changed so as to assume a whitish
Colour, but was not considerably
coagulated; which it was the less,
because the austere Parts were most
of them, with some of the Acid,
precipitated into the Gum which
had been separated from the serous
Part. But if the Spirit of Vitriol
and the Mucilage are first mixed,
and the austere Liquor be afterwards
added, they make a very considerable
and plentiful <i>Coagulum</i>,
which will only be broken into
smaller Parts, and not be dissolved
in Water. <i>Aqua Fortis</i>, and the
Decoction of Galls being both dropt
into some of the Mucilage, made a
white <i>Coagulum</i>, which likewise
was not dissolved in Water, altho’
with <i>oleum Tartari per Deliquium</i>,
and so with Spirit of <i>Sal Ammoniac</i>
dropt into it, I presently dissolved it.
I found likewise, that the <i>Coagulum</i>
made with the Infusion of Pomegranate
Peel, red Roses and Balaustia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
being mixed with some of the
Mucilage, to which an Acid had
been put, made the <i>Coagulum</i>
more firm, so that it would not
dissolve in fair Water; but yet the
Oyl of Tartar by <i>Deliquium</i>, and
the Spirit of <i>Sal Ammoniac</i>, did the
Business in all of them. The
<i>Coagulum</i> of the Mucilage made
with an Acid, and the Infusion of
the <i>Peruvian</i> Bark and several other
Astringents, I kept and dried, which
when they were first put to the Teeth,
seemed a little gritty, though after
they were moist they were of a softer
Nature. All the Mixtures made
of the Mucilage with an Acid and
an Austere, produced not only a
plentiful Coagulation of a white
Colour, but such a one as was of a
thicker Consistence, and not Soluble
in fair Water, as that was which
was made with an Acid only.</p>

<h2>CHAP. IV.</h2>

<p>It is now proper to apply what
hath been hitherto delivered, to
the Distemper we are treating of,
that from thence the Powers of Milk
in the Cure may more clearly appear.
We have shewed before how
the Mass of the Blood becomes impregnated
with a saline Acrimony,
more or less Acid, from a sharp and
indigested Chyle, and the Powers of
Digestion weakned and impaired;
whence is easily explained how the
Lymph and acrid <i>Serum</i> is communicated
to the mucilaginous Glands,
and the smallest Branches of the Arteries,
so as to infect and coagulate
the Mucilage, in Proportion to the
Quantity of Salts they contain. The
Fibres of the Membranes and Tendons
are vellicated by the Acrimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of those Salts, so as to occasion intolerable
Pain, and affect the Nerves
to a very great Degree.</p>

<h3>SECT. 2.</h3>

<p>From the Diversity of Pains and
other Symptoms in the Gout, it appears
that these saline Particles are
sometimes salt and pungent, sometimes
more volatile, sharp and burning.
That the mucilaginous Humour
is frequently acid and corrosive
in the Gout, appears from hence,
that this Liquor is neither so easily
coagulated, nor acquires so great a
Degree of Viscidity by any other
Mixture as with austere Acids, and
from the Obstinacy and Duration
of the Pain. It is frequently observed,
that upon the Approach of a
Fit, People complain of sowre Belchings,
Wind, and vomit acid Humours,
so that hypochondriac People,
and such as are subject to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Gravel, are most apt to be seized
with this Distemper; this may afford
a good Reason why not only
the drinking of acid Wines bring on
a Fit in gouty Persons, but originally
occasion the Gout in such Persons
as frequently drink them. The
Mixture of Wine with the Mucilage
plainly evinces, that the acid Particles
of the Wine give a Disposition
to the Distemper, for it caused
a greater Coagulation of the Mucilage
than Oyl of Vitriol, whence
easily appears what Mischief it may
do to gouty Persons.</p>

<h3>SECT. 3.</h3>

<p>How this sharp acid Humour comes
to be secerned in the Glands, seems
to want Explanation, and this I judge
to be in the following Manner. The
Blood being first imbued with a sufficient
Quantity of these saline heterogeneous
Particles, which it receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
from the corrupted Chyle, is
by Degrees disturbed in its Motion,
and the Fibres of the Nerves begin
to be sensibly irritated, so as to cause
irregular Motions of the animal Spirits.
The Blood itself is thickned,
because these saline and viscid Particles
get into the small Ramifications
of the Arteries, and occasion Obstructions
there; by this Means the natural
Functions and Secretions of the
Humours, especially in the Glands,
are disturbed, and proceed slower;
and accordingly for some Time before
the Fit, we find Complaints of
Crudities in the Stomach, a swelling
and Heaviness of Body, and Weakness
and Numbness of the Limbs,
which increase daily till the Fit is
formed. At length the Blood, by
continued Irritations, being put into
more violent Motions, drives these
saline heterogeneous viscid Particles
through the obstructed Capillaries
into the glandular Vesicles, whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
without doubt the Juices there secerned,
especially that of which we
are speaking, <i>viz.</i> the Mucilage in
the Glands in and about the Joints,
is not only plentifully stored with
these acid corrosive Salts, becomes
more viscid and ropy, but also very
corrosive and poignant; and while
it irritates and corrodes the adjoining
Membranes and Tendons, not
only causes violent Pains, but also
since by the Contraction of the
Nerves the Blood cannot move so
freely through the smallest Vessels,
the Fibres are distended, and an inflammatory
Tumor frequently succeeds.</p>

<h3>SECT. 4.</h3>

<p>The Reason why the Gout affects
particularly the Hands and Feet, and
not all the Joints together, where
Glands of the same Nature are placed,
seems to be this: The Blood
vitiated in the Manner before explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
propelling these saline Parts
into the Pores of the Glands, from
the inequality of its Motion in the
Time of a Fit, does not impel
those Salts with an equable Force,
but chiefly into such Parts (especially
the Feet and other pendulous
Members) where the Pressure and
Impulse lies heaviest; so dilates
the Cavities of the smallest Canals,
till at length it deposits Part
of such Salts, with other viscid Humours,
upon those Glands. Thus
being partly freed from those Salts,
the Gout does not seize other Parts
with the same Violence; for frequently
a large Quantity of such vitiated
Humours are secerned by
Urine, Sweat, and other more open
Passages; and it even often happens,
that Persons whose Juices are
much corrupted, have avoided the
Distemper by the Laxity and Openness
of their Vessels; yet these very
Persons, when the Blood becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
oppressed by these saline Particles
in so great Degree, as not to be readily
discharged by the larger Passages,
they affect the Mucilage in
the Glands and occasion the Gout.</p>

<h3>SECT. 5.</h3>

<p>That this Distemper comes by
Fits, appears owing to this, that upon
the Approach of a Fit much of
the morbifick Matter is thrown upon
the Glands by the Blood, so that
the Blood thus freed from sharp and
viscid Particles, moves easier and
freer, till such Time as a sufficient
Quantity of morbifick Matter is
again generated in the Blood; which
by separating again, a viscid and
sharp Mucilage, the Symptoms of
the Gout, are repeated in another
Fit. The feverish Chilliness and
Shivering that attends the Gout, is
to be accounted for from the irregular
Motion of the Blood, occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
by the Salt and viscid Particles;
and it is very likely that those very
Salts themselves, irritating the Nerves,
and occasioning inordinate and violent
Motions of the animal Spirits,
contribute to such a Fever; this
Sharpness of the Blood, while the
Salts are thrown forth by Urine or
Sweat, remits till the Blood be again
infected. We observe that the Gout
often prevents other Distempers;
for by this Expulsion of the corrupted
Parts from the Blood, Distempers
which might have arisen
from them are prevented.</p>

<h3>SECT. 6.</h3>

<p>Because there is a great Difference
made between the fixed and wandering
Gout, I shall observe a
few Things thereon. As to the
wandering Gout, it is observable
that the Mucilage of the Glands is
often very differently affected from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the viscid and saline Particles of the
Blood; sometimes these Particles
are mixed in different Quantities
with the Mucilage, neither have the
Salts at all Times the same Degree
of Volatility or Fixity; so that the
Mucilage may at some Times be
only lightly infected, and the Infection
be more Volatile, and consequently
it may easily move from
one Joint to another, or attack
many Joints at a Time. The Points
of the Salts are in a Manner lixiviated,
become more volatilized, and
of Consequence are with more ease
protruded from the Blood into the
Glands, and render the mucilaginous
Juices sharper; whence the
nervous Membranes are irritated and
distended, and the gouty Pain generated.</p>

<h3>SECT. 7.</h3>

<p>The Reason why this morbid
Matter is not long fixed in a Place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
but is apt to wander from one Joint
to another, I take to be this: These
saline volatile Particles, when their
intestine Motions are increased, are
very easily dissipated, either through
the Pores of the Skin in sensible
Transpiration and Sweat, or by insensible
Perspiration, and so the
Pain ceases; other Glands, whose
Pores are more open to receive this
acrid volatile Matter, are for the like
Reasons infected, the same Tragedy
repeated, and the Particles in like
manner dissipated. This is the Reason
why the Pains in the Gout are
not fixed and permanent, but rather
wandring and uncertain, the morbid
Particles being attenuated, and
pushing to get forth by the Methods
now mentioned, vellicate the Nerves
in various Directions. It may be
further considered, that when by
the smallness of the Pores or glandulous
Vessels, or any other Disposition,
the morbifick Matter cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
be separated from them in sufficient
Quantity, and the Secretion once
begun is stopped, it recurs to other
Glands of the same kind, and thus
the morbid Matter is suddenly translated
from one Joint to another,
and from one Sett of Glands to
others, so as to produce this Effect.</p>

<h3>SECT. 8.</h3>

<p>As to the fixed Gout, where the
morbid Matter remains long in a
Place, I take it that many acid
Salts and viscid Humours contained
in the Blood, occasion a greater
Coagulation and Viscidity in the
Mucilage about the Joints and
the Tendons, than can be easily
dispersed and evacuated; and on
the contrary growing more viscid
and sharp, it distends and vellicates
the small Fibres of the Tendons and
nervous Membranes, and occasions
a Pain proportional to the Degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of Acrimony and Viscidity in the
Mucilage about the Joints and Tendons,
generally pretty sharp. The
Mucilage is affected in the same
Manner as it would be from the
Affusion of <i>Aqua Fortis</i>, Spirit of
Vitriol, or any other corrosive acid
or austere Substance, whence it is
manifestly thickned and coagulated.
This affords a Reason why
such a Gout is not only fixed in a
particular Limb, but also why it
long remains there. The ingenious
Dr. <i>Havers</i> explains this Matter
very well; he tells us that when the
Matter happens to be thick and gelatinous,
it is not to be expected that
it should be easily and presently
discharged out of the Interstices of
the Joints, either by being resorbed
or evaporated, when the Consistence
of it renders it uncapable of insinuating
itself into the minute Pores,
and penetrating those narrow Avenues
through which it is to pass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
And according to the Degree and
Nature of the Acid in the morbific
Humour, it doth more or less coagulate
the Mucilage, and the Part
affected is sooner or later, with more
or less Difficulty, freed from it, either
by the Translation of it to another,
or by the more happy Exclusion of
it out of the Body. The same Author
very elegantly explains the
Cause of the Knots in the Joints,
where he says that it seems to be
no difficult Thing to account for
that tophaceous Matter, which is
sometimes found concreted in those
Parts that have been afflicted with
this Distemper. It hath been observed,
that an Acid and an Austere,
being both mixed with the Mucilage,
did produce a plain, a notable
and white Coagulation, where the
<i>Coagulum</i>, though it was made
when the Mucilage was cold, was
not so soft and tender, nor dissolvable
in Water like that which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
made with Acids only; but though
it would break, remained distinct
in it, and being dried, was
easily reducible to a fine Powder like
Flower, or the fine Powder of Chalk.
Whence he humbly conceives, that
where-ever the Gout comes to be
nodose, there is not only an Acidity
in the preternatural Humour,
which is separated by the mucilaginous
Glands, and mixed with the
Mucilage; but it is an Acid austere,
which is no sooner thrown into the
Interstices of the Joints and the Sinuses
of the Tendons which are
thereabout, but it produces a <i>Coagulum</i>
in the Mucilage, and that
such a one as is not easily attenuated
and dissolved, so that it lies fixed
and imprisoned there, and in
Time, as the aqueous and moist
Particles are by the Heat and Spirits
carried off, the terrestrial and
saline Parts concentrated come
nearer together, and coming to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
immediately contiguous, do mutually
adhere, and are concreted so as
to produce that Chalk or tophaceous
Matter which is in some arthritick
Cases to be observed. And as the
<i>Coagulum</i>, which may be made by
an Acid austere, seems apt to make
a Concretion of that nature, so the
Colour of the tophaceous Matter
doth answer to that of this Coagulation,
so as to seem generated
in this Manner.</p>

<h3>SECT. 9.</h3>

<p>The same Author explains the
Reason why the Hands and Feet
are most subject to this Disorder.
In the Hands, as was shewn before,
there not only are considerable
Glands in all their Joints, but the
Tendons which are there inserted,
especially those of the <i>Musculi perforantes</i>,
have their mucilaginous
Glands, so that Nature hath a convenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in these Parts to depurate
the Mass of Blood, and they must
receive the morbifick Matter, when
the Blood in its Circulation obtrudes
it upon them, and the
Glands are disposed to separate it.
The same Thing may be observed
of the Shoulder and of the Knees.
But of all the Parts none are so frequently
afflicted with this Disease
as the Feet, and it is plain why they
are so. For besides, that they have
many mucilaginous Glands in their
Joints, and others about the Tendons
which are inserted into their
Bones, as the great Chord or Tendon
of the Muscles which extend
the Foot, and those of the <i>Perforantes</i>;
I say besides this, they are the
inferior and pendulous Parts, so that
as their Glands make them capable
of entertaining, so their Situation
does conspire with the Effort of Nature,
to bring down the morbifick
Matter into them. Thus far Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<i>Havers</i>, whom I have chosen to
quote, because he hath exceeded all
Authors in treating of the Nature of
this Distemper. It is not necessary
to add any more upon this Head.
What I have omitted for Brevity’s
Sake, the Reader may find in my
<i>Encyclopædia Medica</i>, where I have
treated of the Cause of this Distemper,
and evidently shewed how from
the Glands and Lymphatick Ducts
about the Membranes and nervous
Parts of the Joints, a large Quantity
of sharp <i>Serum</i> and other lixivial
and acid Particles or other morbid
Matter thickning and corrupting the
Lymph, is secreted and deposited
upon the Joints, where they corrode
and vellicate the nervous Fibres.
Upon the Addition of Particles more
than ordinary acid, the Pains become
more durable and fixed; insomuch
as Salts of different Natures become
jumbled together, and from the Agitation
and Conflict of the Particles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the Membranes are vellicated and
distended in a very painful Manner;
neither doth the Pain abate till the
Particles get forth of the Glands,
or their Conflict being over, leave
the Spirits at rest.</p>

<h2>CHAP. V.</h2>

<p>In the next Place we are to enquire
into the Properties of Milk,
and to find out whence it hath such
wonderful Powers in asswaging and
curing this Distemper. There are
some Authors, especially the Followers
of <i>Sylvius</i>, who according
to the chymical Scheme would have
Milk produced from the Blood in
the following Manner; Chyle, which
is of a white Colour, may be turned
into Blood by the Help of Alcalies;
and again the Blood may be reduced
to Chyle by the Help of Acids.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<i>Junkius</i>, in his Chymistry, hath
noted the Experiments when Milk
is to be turned into Blood: Take a
Pound of new Milk, and mix with
it an Ounce of reverberated Salt of
Tartar in a large Vessel; in a Quarter
of an Hour the Mixture shall turn
into a Blood red Colour, several
Fibres swimming at Top like Cream.
When the Blood is to be turned into
Milk, take any Quantity of the
foregoing Mixture, and drop in
some Vinegar, and it shall immediately
re-assume the Form of Milk.
In the first Experiment they alledge,
that the crude Sulphur of the Chyle
is by the Alkali exalted into a red
Sulphur; in the second, the exalting
Alkali is depressed by the Acid,
whence the Sulphur returns to its
original white Colour. <i>Junkius</i>
is very justly doubtful of the Application
of this Experiment; how
the crude Sulphur of the Chyle, as
they call it, should in so short a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Time be changed into Blood by Alkalies,
and the Blood, exalted by so
many Circulations, be again changed
into Milk by Acids, seems very
strange. It requires a good deal of
Time to change the Chyle into perfect
Blood, and the Blood again
into Milk, notwithstanding that
Women who have no Milk find it
in their Breasts soon after Childbirth.</p>

<h3>SECT. 2.</h3>

<p>In order to be fully satisfied of
the Nature of Milk, it is necessary
to examine into the Manner of its
Generation: It seems reasonable to
imagine, that the Chyle, once received
into the lacteal Vessels, and
at length mixed with the Blood, is
never again let forth with the same
Appearance; only in Women at the
Time of Childbirth, when it is plentifully
separated, through the Ramifications
of the Arteries, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
conglomerate Glands of the Breast.
There is evidently a great Agreement
between the Milk and the Chyle, in
as much as the Chyle consists of a
watry, limpid and gelatinous Fluid,
with oily or fat Globules swimming
therein. These Globules are pellucid,
and differ both in Size and
Figure; the Reason of its Whiteness
is to be imputed to this: The
oily Globules are mixed with the
watry ones, in such Manner that
several very smooth Globules are
formed, which reflecting the Rays
of Light in right Lines, occasion a
white Colour; the same thing is
observable in making Emulsions
with oily Seeds, or upon mixing resinous
Essences with Water, or mixing
Oyl and Water, and shaking
them well together; in these Cases,
the watry and oily Particles, being
thoroughly mixed, occasion such a
Superficies as reflects a white Colour.
<i>Bolin</i>, and several Authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
have proved, that the Milk is no
other than oily or fat Lymph or
Chyle, brought with the Blood to
the Breasts, and there deposited in
the milky Cells. <i>Berger</i> hath very
well explained the Manner of its
Separation in the Breasts. The
whole Substance of the Breasts, in
Women giving Suck, is made up
of various Ramifications of Arteries,
from the thoracick and mamillary
Arteries, which terminate in oval
Cells, or glandulary Follicles; from
hence the Breast swells with many
milky Vessels, terminating in the
Nipple; through these the more
oily and chylous Parts of the Blood
are derived from the Glands, where
it is not only separated, and received,
but gathered and preserved,
while the remaining Mass of the
Blood is returned by the Veins and
Lymphaticks. These milky Rivulets,
after breaking very small from
the Ramifications of the Arteries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
flow together into several larger
Trunks, which in their Progress are
united by Insertions of their Parts,
in some Places more dilated, in others
streightned, from several Cells
and Cisterns, where the Milk is gathered
and preserved, so as always
to have a sufficient Quantity for the
Nourishment of the Infant. Lastly,
as the Chyle is separated from
the Mass of the Food in the Bowels,
not by any Precipitation, but by
Percolation only; and as in the making
of Emulsions, the oily Seeds
communicate an oily Milkiness to
the Water, and is separated from
the grosser Parts by the Sieve, without
the Intervention of any precipitating
Medicine, so the chylous
Juice is separated in the Bowels by
gentle Pressure or the Peristaltick
Motion, and strained through the
Orifices of the lacteal Vessels, to be
thence thrown into the Mass of the
Blood. In like manner, the Milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is barely separated, by straining the
milky Particles from the Blood,
through the small Ramifications of
the Arteries in the Glands of the
Breasts.</p>

<h3>SECT. 3.</h3>

<p><i>Nuck</i> hath sometime ago demonstrated,
that these conglomerate
Glands are a Bundle of small Vessels;
that their excretory Ducts are
Continuations of the arterial Ramifications,
and that these Glands
owe their Origin to the smallest
Branches of the Arteries: These
Arteries, which enter the glandular
Substance of the Breasts, are imperceptible
to the naked Eye, and discoverable
only by injecting a very
fine Tincture (which <i>Nuck</i> tells us
is known to very few Anatomists)
into the Artery; this may be so far
propelled, as to render the milky
Ducts conspicuous. For the better
Discovery of this Matter, <i>Nuck</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
instituted another Experiment equally
curious and useful; having met
a Nipple full of excretory Ducts, he
pressed it, and the Breast adjoining,
so as to empty all its Contents, and
having pitched upon one of the widest
Ducts, he injected <i>Mercury</i> so
artificially, that he immediately observed
the milky Ducts spread like
Branchings of Trees; some Part of
the <i>Mercury</i> was carried so far as to
enter the Arteries, whence the milky
Vessels were continued.</p>

<h3>SECT. 4.</h3>

<p>Hence it follows, that these milky
Ducts are destitute of Valves, otherwise
the <i>Mercury</i> and the injected
Liquors would have been obstructed
in their Passage. It is indeed
observable, that these Canals
are in some Places streighter and
narrower than in others, so as to
give some kind of Obstacle to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Injection; this is not to be imputed
to Valves, but to some kind of
Hardness peculiar to the Substance
of the Glands, by which the milky
Vessels are compressed. From hence
appears the immediate Inosculation
of the milky Ducts, with the small
Ramifications of the Arteries, of
which these Glands are composed;
so that the arterial Blood propels
and deposits its chylous and serous
Particles by gentle Pressure and
Impulse in the milky Ducts, without
other Mechanism than bare
Straining and Secretion. For the
further and more exact Description
of these Ducts, see <i>Nuck’s Adenographia</i>.</p>

<h3>SECT. 5.</h3>

<p>It remains now to examine, of
what kind of Particles chiefly Milk
is composed; which appear to be
these three: The first is a fat, butyraceous,
oily, and sulphureous Substance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
The second is cheesy, earthy,
chalky, and saline. The third
is the Vehicle of these, <i>viz.</i> serous,
which is watry, with a Mixture of
nitrous Salts. But these Parts don’t
hold the same Proportion in the
Milk of all Animals; Cows Milk is
most used in Food, it is thick and
fat, and contains more Butter than
the Milk of other Animals; upon
which account it nourishes more,
and is more agreeable to the human
Body. Ews Milk hath more earthy
and cheesy Particles; Goats
Milk is in a Mean between these two,
only that its <i>Serum</i> contains more
of a nitrous Salt; whence <i>Etmuller</i>
conjectures, that it hath all the Virtues
of Whey made from Cows
Milk, especially in Heats and scorbutick
Cases. Asses Milk is of all
the thinnest, next to human; the
Milk of other Animals, as not so
usually brought into Food, I forbear
to describe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<h3>SECT. 6.</h3>

<p>It is manifest, that every Part of
the Milk exerts an Effect proper to
it self; the fat Part, from which
the Butter is formed, preserves from
the Stone, which affords an evident
Reason why Stones taken from the
human Body, upon Distillation,
afford so small a Portion of Oyl;
whence I am of Opinion, that the
Stone is most commonly generated
in the Kidneys and Bladder, when
the Blood is not sufficiently stocked
with oily Particles. Upon this Principle
it is easy to see why all oily
Substances, as Oyl of Sweet Almonds,
taken plentifully, is a Remedy
in the Stone; for the oily
Particles (as <i>Hoffman</i> observes in his
Notes upon <i>Poterius</i>) by their
Hooks hinder the Saline <i>Spicula</i>
from uniting so as to form an hard
Substance. It is known in the Chymistry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that Oyl resists Crystallization;
and many Artists that are
minded to have beautiful Crystals,
add rectified Spirit of Wine to their
Lye, in order to absorb the Oyl.
Upon the same Principles, the Precipitation
of the earthy Particles,
and the lodging thereof in the
Membranes of the Joints, so as to
form chalky Knots, are prevented.
<i>Poterius</i> tells us of a Woman of Sixty,
who was so reduced in her Flesh
and Strength, that she was scarce
sensible of Pain, who by the Help
of Goat’s Milk, was in three Months
Time restored to a State of perfect
Health, notwithstanding a great
Decay of Strength and Flesh, an
Hectick Fever, and a Stone; she
took at first but four Ounces of the
Milk, which was at length increased
to eight; at the End of fifteen
Days she voided some oblong and
Very hard Stones, upon which she
began to recover. She continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the Use of the Milk for a Month, at
which Time the Fever left her, her
Appetite returned, and she began to
gather Flesh. She was alive and hearty
in the Sixty Eighth Year of her
Age, when <i>Poterius</i> gave his Account.
Although in this Case the
oily Particles of the Blood might
contribute much to lubricate the
Passages, yet probably the serous
Part of the Goats Milk, impregnated
with a nitrous abstersive Salt,
attenuated the thicker Humours,
and irritated the nervous membranous
Parts to discharge the
Stones. It is observable that after
taking plentifully of Milk, the Urine
is not only thin and watry, but
made also in large Quantities. This
fat Substance in the Milk also loosens
the Bowels and softens Pain, it resists
corrosive Poisons, in as much as
it sheaths and anoints the sharp
<i>Spicula</i> thereof. Many Empiricks,
to shew the Force of their Antidotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
(which are generally good for nothing)
to the ignorant Multitude,
having lined their Stomachs well
with Butter, or Oyl, either of Olive
or Sweet Almonds, will securely
swallow Mercury and even Arsenick,
and afterwards taking the pretended
Specifick, cheat the poor People
of their Money. <i>Poterius</i> experienced
the good Effects of Milk,
plentifully taken, to break the Force
of Poyson; for a Woman, who being
very dry, had drank <i>Aqua Fortis</i> instead
of Wine, was relieved from
the immediate Danger of Death by
drinking plentifully of Steeled Milk,
with a Dram of Wax, a little Nutmeg,
and <i>Terra Lemnia</i>. <i>Tulpius</i>,
in his Observations takes Notice,
that <i>Goldsmiths</i>, while they handle
Mercury and Antimony, keep in
their Mouths a bit of Bread thick
buttered, or take fat Broths, to
guard against their mischievous <i>Effluvia</i>.
Milk, by reason of its Oiliness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
is one of the best, temperate,
and nourishing of Foods; nothing
exceeds it in consumptive Cases.
These Particles admirably temper
any Sharpness in the Body, and are
serviceable where the Kidneys are
ulcerated, and to scorbutick People,
especially if the Juice of Cresses or
Scurvygrass be added to it, and taken
two Hours before Meals. It is
of great Service in Dysenteries, where
there is great Sharpness in the first
Passages, and chiefly after the Use
of absorbent Medicines. Upon the
same Account it eases Pains in the
Eyes, and the serous Part of the
Milk helps much to dilute the Salts;
dropt into the Ear, it asswages Pains
there, especially when it is attended
with a buzzing Noise.</p>

<h3>SECT. 7.</h3>

<p>Since it appears that Milk, by
reason of its oily Particles, is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
serviceable in mitigating and curing
these Disorders, there is no room to
doubt, from Parity of Reason, that
the frequent Use of it in the Gout
should not break and invert the austere,
sharp, saline Particles, and
drive them forth of the Body by
Perspiration, Urine, or other Discharges;
for, (as <i>Waldsmid</i> observes)
Salts predominate in this Distemper,
which is evident from the
itching in the Skin observed to attend
the Decline of a Fit. The volatile
Salt of the serous Humour going
off, insensibly frets the Skin,
while that which is fixed in the
thick and viscid Humour, and cannot
easily fly off, hardens into Knots.
I have observed, upon the Application
of Blisters to gouty Persons, a
Liquor of an high corrosive Nature
to flow from the Part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<h3>SECT. 8.</h3>

<p>I now come to examine the second
essential Part of Milk, <i>viz.</i>
that which is cheesy, earthy, and
somewhat saline. I am not of Opinion
that the Acid of the Stomach
is increased by this Part, for there
is no Acid naturally in the Stomach;
if there were, it would be mischievous.
Although it be certain that
Cheese is acid, and turns sharper
by Age, yet those Particles which
are precipitated into Chese, are
vastly different in the Chyle and the
Milk, from what they are in a State
of Separation, and after being exposed
to the Air. The Salts, which
before were nitrous, and of a middle
Nature, somewhat volatile, and
mixed with oily, sulphureous, or
earthy Particles, being agitated by
an inward Motion, become more
stiff and complicated. These Salts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
while in a State of Union with the
Milk and Chyle in the Body, by
Means of the progressive Motion,
are more disunited and smaller, the
serous and oily Particles keeping
them asunder; and there is neither
Time nor Rest allowed them in
their natural State to produce fresh
Combinations, as they have when
deprived of their progressive Motion,
in a State of Separation from
the Body. That Milk in warm Weather
turns sowre, is to be imputed
to its intestine Motion, where the
Salts, before small and somewhat nitrous,
mixed with the oily Particles
by the Influx of the Air, change
their natural Texture and Figure,
and become more rigid and heavy,
and so precipitate the light, viscid,
and earthy Particles. That the Air
contributes much to this Change,
appears from hence, because that
alone produces a remarkable Quantity
of acid Salts in some Bodies. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a Piece of Alum be calcined in the
open Fire, upon exposing it again
to the Air, it shall double its
Weight; so that a large Quantity
of aluminous acid Salt may be
drawn from thence: And although
Milk be coagulated in the Breasts,
it happens either from an acid Acrimony
in the Blood, or its Motion
being stopped, and some Obstructions
of the milky Vessels. It doth
not appear from any Experiment
yet known, that healthy Milk fresh
drawn contains any Acid; the Manner
in which this Part of the Milk
acquires this Tendency, I conceive
to be this: We have already asserted,
that Milk, in its natural State,
contains no Acid, although after
being exposed to Warm Air, by
Means of some Fermentation and
inward Motion, it becomes acid,
which is to be look’d upon as a new
Production, no way relating to Milk
in its natural State. The cheesy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Particles of Milk, if I may so call
them, when in the Body differ extremely
from those which out of the
Body form the Cheese; for while in
the Body, they are in the Shape of
earthy, subtile, viscid Particles, mixed
with the Milk, Chyle, and Blood;
they give a due Consistence to the
Milk, by duly mixing the oily, fat
and serous Particles with them, and
while in their due progressive Motion,
keep the Milk in a proper
Temperature, and occasion a slower
Motion of the Milk through the
milky Vessels.</p>

<h3>SECT. 9.</h3>

<p>It may be asked, How this Part
of the Milk comes to be serviceable
in the Gout, and other scorbutick
Disorders? Because its Parts are slimy,
chalky, and earthy, they gently
temper the Acrimony of the Humours,
and imbibe and absorb it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and this is the Reason why the Milk
of Nurses who feed upon Acids, or
whose Blood hath a Tendency that
Way, soon turns; for such acid
Particles being separated in the
Glands of the Breasts, by coagulating
and thinning the Milk, by separating
from the other Particles of
the Milk, and staying behind, are
the Occasion that the Milk comes
out unfit for Nourishment.</p>

<h3>SECT. 10.</h3>

<p>The third Part of the Milk, which
is serous, contains watry, gelatinous
and nitrous Particles; if Milk
sowres and coagulates out of the
Body, the gelatinous Parts of the
<i>Serum</i>, being somewhat thicker and
more earthy, change their Motion
and Situation, and being more closely
mixed with the oily Particles, become
that cheesy Substance we before
took Notice of. The Power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the <i>Serum</i> is to be attributed to its
watry and abstersive nitrous Particles,
by Means whereof it hath a
Power of deterging, consolidating,
sweetning and tempering the Acrimony
of the Humours, and of increasing
the Discharges by Urine and
Siege; it removes Obstructions in
the Bowels, heals Ulcers, and corrects
the Sharpness of the Humours,
in as much as it dilutes the acrid and
volatile Salts, and fixes them by
means of its nitrous Particles. It is
of great use in feverish Heats, and by
its alexipharmick Power is much
esteemed in malignant Fevers, so
that its Virtue in the Gout is less to
be wondered at. In the Gout, the
fixed morbid Matter sticking in the
small Canals, and the Interstices of
the Membranes and mucilaginous
Glands, is very tough, viscid, sharp
and austere; the serous Particles of
the Milk easily pass through and
pervade those Ducts and Canals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
by the watry Particles dilute those
sharp Salts and stagnating Humours,
and partly imbibe and absorb them;
so that either by insensible Perspiration,
Urine, or some other Discharge,
they send them forth of the Body.
For this End they correct and break
them so as to make their Passage
easier. It is observable, that the Salts
of the <i>Serum</i> easily assimilate themselves
to other Salts, and upon this
Account a difference of Food occasions
different Milk. Goats that
have fed upon purging Herbs, Spurge
or Scammony, as in <i>Syria</i> or other
Countries where such Herbs grow
wild, give Milk endowed with a
strong purgative Power; and Saffron
frequently given communicates
both its Smell and Colour to
the Milk.</p>

<h3>SECT. 11.</h3>

<p>For these Reasons those that feed
upon Milk should take Care that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the Animal they take it from have
sweet and good Pasture; Cows give
sweeter and better Milk in Summer,
when fed upon odoriferous Grass,
than in Winter on Hay and Straw.
I do not think it necessary here, to
recite all the Virtues of the serous
Part of the Milk in the Cure of other
Distempers, because they are well
known to Physicians; but it may
be observed, that the several essential
Parts of Milk, which I have here explained,
being united and thoroughly
mixed, as they are in the Milk,
exert a greater Efficacy in dissolving
and breaking the Salts and viscid
Humours that lodge about the
Joints, and expelling the gouty
Matter. When the Blood is impregnated
with Milk, it yields a softer
Liquor to the mucilaginous
Glands of the Joints, so that the
Membranes and Tendons are lubricated
with a soft insipid Mucilage,
and the natural Motions are performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
without Pain or Uneasiness;
or if the Membranes be too dry, or
complicated with any sharp Matter,
which occasions Obstructions, they
are so relaxed, that upon removing
the Obstruction they regain their
former Force and Vigour. Care
must be taken of what I before advised,
that before the Milk be thoroughly
brought into Use, the latent
Acid in the Bowels be first corrected
and discharged by absorbent and
cleansing Medicines, and a laudable
Diet premised for some Time,
that no Coagulation of the Milk, or
other Inconveniencies, be incurred.
Upon this Foot a certain Cure is to
be expected. A prudent Physician
will easily dispose a Body whose
Powers are not entirely destroyed to
receive this Diet. Perhaps some
may object here, that the Gout being
caused by an acid Salt, rendring
the Juices about the Joints more
viscid and sharp, therefore so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
as there remains a Disposition to the
Gout, from this Cause, Milk cannot
safely be brought into Use. To
this I answer, That the Gout is
often caused by a singular lixivial
Salt, and bilious Acrimony, especially
in Persons of a sanguine Constitution,
where no volatile Acid is
observable, either in the first Passages,
or in the Blood; or if there be
any acid Salts in the first Passages,
by frequent Circulations they are so
joined with the volatile Salt of the
Blood, that they become lixivial and
bilious. But when there really are
acid Humours in the Body, by taking
alcaline Absorbents and Cleansers
of the Blood, and by proper
Diet, they may be so corrected, as
from Acids to become lixivial, and
assume the Nature of middle Kind
of Salts. Upon the frequent Use of
alkaline Absorbents, the Pains of the
Gout are mightily lessened, because
the solid <i>Spicula</i> of the Acid are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>broke and changed. Upon this
Principle, Dr. <i>Willis</i> his Mixture of
the Solution of Salt of Tartar, and
<i>Sal Ammoniac</i>, in Rain Water, externally
applied, is an excellent Remedy.
A Friend of mine used to
remove the Pains of the Gout instantly,
by an Ointment made of
Quick Lime; and upon the same
Principles, Spirit of <i>Sal Ammoniac</i>,
Camphire, Spirit and Oyl of Tartar,
and even Urine, wonderfully
remove the Pain; as also Spirit of
Scurvygrass, Cresses, <i>Sal Volatile</i>,
Amber, and others of that Class.
When the Humours that cause the
Gout are more bilious, lixivial, and
corrosive, these Medicines are not
so proper; for volatile and spirituous
Medicines increase the Distemper;
but the more fixed nitrous Absorbents,
oily and acid, ought to be
externally applied; as Balsam of
<i>Sulphur</i> with Amber, Bathing, and
Spirit of Pismires, sowre Buttermilk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Herring Brine, the Juice of Earthworms
expressed with Wine, as being
full of nitrous Salts, a Poultice
of Bread and Milk, with a little Saffron,
or Bole, or sealed Earth, or the
inward Use of the Decoctions of
the Woods, and many other earthy
Absorbents. <i>Caspar Rheinbold</i>, his
Highness’s Principal Apothecary,
prepares a Medicine from Gold
chemically, which is an admirable
Secret in the Cure of the Gout, of
which I can attest the Truth. It is
also excellent in the Stone, prevents
its growing, and mitigates the Pain
of it. The Antients exhibited the
Juice of Earthworms expressed in
Milk, with Success: By these Means
the corrosive and volatile Salts are
inverted, fixed, and thrown forth of
the Body by Urine and Sweat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<h3>SECT. 12.</h3>

<p>Because the morbid Matter rests
chiefly about the Tendons and nervous
Membranes, especially in the
mucilaginous Glands, and cannot
suddenly and at one Push be
driven out of such narrow Vessels
and Cells; it is necessary to continue
the Diet for a good while, till
the Body be thoroughly purged of
vicious Humours, and begins as it
were to renew its Youth. Lenient
and laxative Purgers are sometimes
to be used, because the Stomach
and Bowels in gouty Persons are
weak; so that it often happens that
Milk, by reason of the slow Progress
of Chylification, by its intestine
Motion, is vehemently agitated
and precipitated, so as to occasion
a Slime in the first Passages;
but in a little Time this Evil is prevented
by such Medicines as strengthen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the Stomach, and prevent Coagulations
in the Milk; the most lenient
Purgatives are the best, and
Rhubarb to be preferred for at
the same Time that it evacuates, it
gives a fresh Tone to the Fibres of
the Bowels.</p>

<h3>SECT. 13.</h3>

<p>The Excellency of Milk, not only
in the Gout, but in other Disorders,
having been thus demonstrated,
I shall subjoin the Judgment of
some Authors in its Favour. <i>Emmanuel
Konig</i>, in his <i>Regnum Animale</i>,
admires the wonderful Power
of Milk in Medicine, as well as Nourishment.
<i>Wepfer</i>, in his Observations,
says, there is certainly somewhat
divine in Milk, since we see
gouty Persons relieved by it, Hypocondriack
and Nephritick Persons
relieved by its use, the whole Habit
strengthened, the Complexion cleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
up, and fresh Powers acquired
to the Body. He tells us, that he
knew a Gentlewoman at <i>Friburgh</i>,
who was in an almost miraculous
Manner relieved from terrible Convulsions,
Suffocation of the Womb,
Hysterick Symptoms, by the Use of
Milk alone, obstinately persisted in
for some Years. Milk, by its asswaging,
sulphureous Power, and its
nitro-saline deterging Quality, dulcifies
the sharp and acid Humours,
whence its Cream and Butter thence
arising, are very anodine; the one
beat up with Sugar of Lead, corrects
the corrosive Acid in cancerous
Tumours; and the other drank
warm in a <i>Diarrhœa</i>, mitigates
the sharp Twitches in the Bowels
that attend that Distemper, and immediately
asswages and stops the
Pain and Gripings. Externally applied
and rubbed in a proper manner,
it gives Relief in the Stone, and
helps to propel it into the Bladder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<i>Daniel Ludovicus</i> hath asserted,
that Butter either by it self, or
mixed with other Ingredients, exceeds
all the Officinal Ointments
and compound Oyls. In Consumptions
and Hecticks its Powers
are very well known. <i>Solenander</i>
and <i>Konig</i> advise a Pound
of Milk, in which an Handful of
Elder Flowers have been boiled,
drank every Morning for nine Days
successively in <i>May</i>, as a Specifick
in St. <i>Anthony</i>’s Fire. <i>Tachius</i> tells
us of what great Use it was in restoring
crippled Limbs to a Person that
was quite tired out with Baths, and
other Remedies. In the <i>German
Ephemeris</i> there is an Instance of
an Hypocondriac Epilepsy cured by
three Ounces of Milk, in which was
dissolved half a Drachm of <i>Spanish</i>
Soap, taken every Morning. And
<i>Sylvius</i> tells us of many Icterical People
cured by that Medicine.</p>

<h2>CHAP. VI.</h2>

<p>Before I finish this Discourse,
I shall endeavour to
give some Account why People
that have been cured by this
Method, and have lived many
Years free from the Gout, at certain
Times of the Year, particularly
upon Change of Weather,
or at that Time of the Year
when they used to have the Fits,
perceive some slight and obscure
Pains about the Joints of those
Limbs that were formerly attacked.
This I suppose to arise from the
Blood and Humours being thickned
by the preternatural Influence of the
Air at those Seasons; if upon such
a Cause the Humours become thicker
in the mucilaginous Glands, the
Membranes must of course be distended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Now because this doth not
proceed from any particular Acrimony,
but from a Fullness and
slight Distention, therefore the Pain
thence arising is hardly perceivable,
and vanishes upon gentle Exercise
and walking, in which the Motion
of the Blood is a little increased.</p>

<h3>SECT. 2.</h3>

<p>It is necessary in the next Place to
propose and confute some Objections
of Persons who refuse this Diet as
extremely noxious. Altho’, <i>say they</i>,
Persons have found great Benefit by
strictly adhering to this Diet, yet
upon returning again to the Use of
common Food, however mild and
gentle, they have been afflicted with
the Gout worse than ever. The
Powers of the Body being weakned
by this Diet, have been less able to
resist the Force of this Distemper, it
hath become more dangerous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the Fits of longer Continuance. If
we may give Credit to Experience
as well as Reason, we shall find this
Matter far otherwise, for it appears
from what we have said, that many
Persons have not only been freed
from the Gout in this Method, but
have likewise continued free many
Years after they have left it off; particularly
the three Gentlemen now
living at the <i>Hague</i>, the Marquiss
<i>de Bongi</i>, Monsieur <i>Chamar</i>, and
the Counsellour <i>de Talo</i>. It is observable,
that having gone through
the Diet, they returned to different
kinds of Food, and have now lived
with their Friends as usual without
any Inconvenience for several Years,
excepting the Marquiss, who twice
or thrice in the Compass of nine or
ten Years hath been afflicted with it,
(probably owing to some Error in
the Non-Naturals;) it is no less
reasonable to believe, that where the
Aliments are easier changed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
good Chyle, and communicated to
the Blood in proper Quantities, better
Spirits should be produced, and of
Consequence the Vigour of the Parts
should be restored and augmented.
That this is natural to Milk, appears
from common Experience in the
Diet of such as use chiefly Milk and
Water, (as the Country People in
<i>Switzerland</i>) for they exceed those
of other Countries and Places who
live upon Flesh-Meats, in the Largeness
and Health of their Bodies, and
the Floridness of their Complections,
and you shall seldom find any among
them subject to the Gout, the
Scurvy, Hypochondriack, or other
Distempers.</p>

<h3>SECT. 3.</h3>

<p>If any object that gouty Persons,
in the Beginning of the Diet, find
their Stomach and Limbs weakned
by the Milk, so that they have need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of Stomachick and other strengthening
Medicines, let it be remembred
that the Glands of the Stomach and
Bowels in gouty Persons, that furnish
the Stomachick and intestinal
Juices, are obstructed and furred
with a viscid kind of Matter, so that
only the more subtile and liquid
Fluids can enter their Pores; hence
the watry Part of the Milk, with very
few oily nutritious Particles, enter
those Pores and Canals, so that the
Chyle becomes too watry, not being
sufficiently impregnated with a proper
Quantity of oily Particles. This
Chyle not being sufficiently stored
with nutritious Particles, being delivered
into the Blood, occasions a
Languor and Weakness, while the
thicker Parts of the Milk go off with
the Excrement. But after a while,
when the watry Parts of the Milk
have frequently entered the Mass of
the Blood, and have resolved, imbibed
and inverted the corrosive Salts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
coagulate the Humours, and expelled
them by Perspiration or Urine;
then by Degrees, those Humours
that are separated in the Glands,
and serve to the Concoction and
Digestion of the Aliment, as the
Spittle, the Juices of the Stomach
and Bowels, the Bile, the pancreatick
Juice, become thinner, and the
Canals and Pores of those Glands are
rendred fit, not only to receive the
watry Parts of the Milk, but the oily
nutritious Parts also, and of forming
them into good and laudable Chyle.
The Reason why gouty People using
their ordinary Aliment, retain more
Strength and Vigour, is this, not only
the Pores of the Glands of the
Stomach and Bowels are by long use
more apt to admit Particles from
their ordinary Food, but its Parts also
are more thick and heavy, so that
the chylous Part is protruded by the
Weight of the superincumbent Particles.
To this concurrs a particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Acrimony, by Means whereof the
Coats of the Stomach are vellicated,
and exert a greater Force in separating
the Chyle, whereas Milk which
presses more gently, does not so
easily enter Pores stuffed with viscid
Humours, but rather insinuates itself
by Degrees in those Canals
where it can find Passage. If the
Tone of the Bowels be in a natural
State, and the first Passages be not
loaded with acid and viscid Humours,
Milk from a natural Affinity,
is more easily converted into
Chyle, and nourishes and strengthens
the Body more than any other
Food, which takes more Time in
its Digestion, especially if some fine
unfermented Wheaten Bread be taken
along with it; for by this
Means the Parts of the Chyle are
rendred more heavy, and easily enter
the lacteal Vessels, communicate
a solid Nourishment to the Body, and
the Strength thereof is mightily restored,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
without the least Hazard of
any Damage.</p>

<h3>SECT. 4.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding what I have endeavoured
to prove, that gouty Persons,
after having been cured by this
Method, may again return to their
common way of living, without fear
of a Relapse; yet I do not deny but
it is an easy matter to bring on the
Gout again, and that in a more violent
Manner than before, by great
Errors in Diet, indulging in acid
Foods, smoaked Meats, and such as
are flatulent and of bad Digestion;
too frequent drinking of acid and
generous Wines; giving way to the
Passions of Anger and Sorrow, the
use of Women, or being exposed to
the Inclemencies of the Air. No
doubt these will return the Distemper
with great Violence, and bring
the Patient into manifest danger. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is absolutely necessary to chuse such
Food as will give Chyle analogous to
Milk, and to avoid all Acid and Salt
Food with the greatest Caution. And
although some People have indulged
their Appetites after the Cure,
without any great Inconvenience,
yet it is certainly more advisable to
live moderately, since too much
Boldness is not always successful;
which the Patient will certainly be
encouraged to do, upon recalling to
mind the terrible Pains he hath suffered,
hardly relievable by any Art.</p>

<h3>SECT. 5.</h3>

<p>It may be enquired how it comes
to pass, that a Person cured by this
Diet shall continue free from the
Gout, though he return to his former
Method of living, provided he
take every Morning a small Quantity
of warm Milk. The Reason of
this I take to be, that the Milk, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
long Use, during the Time of the
Cure, hath either changed or expelled
all the sharp Acrimony of
the Blood and Humours, and rendred
the Fibres and Membranes
more loose, so that there is an easier
Circulation of the Juices; new acid
Salts are not so easily formed and
thrown upon the Membranes so as
to occasion the Gout, especially if
the Diet be of a good Kind, and a
certain Quantity of Milk taken every
Morning, which by its plentiful oily
Parts, and soft serous ones, prevents
the Salts from uniting. I am sensible
I may have omitted some
Doubts that might arise against the
Use of this Diet, but whatever they
be, they may easily be answered
from what was said before, and the
Use thereof fully cleared up; for
lesser Difficulties, it is not worth
while to spend Time about them.
I shall only add, that several People
have expected the Cure of the Gout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in the Use of Gruels and Water.
As to Water, it is evident from
Experience, as <i>Poterius</i> and <i>Hoffman</i>
have observed, that it is frequently
serviceable in removing this
Distemper. Since gouty Persons are
of a saline Constitution, there cannot
be a better drink used than pure
light Water, that will make its way
both by the Skin and by Urine; for
such drank freely drives forth the
foreign Salts, and makes the Juices
fluid. I have seen Persons cured of
the Gout, whose Joints were contracting,
by drinking only pure
Spring Water in large Quantities.
The Case of a Man, who was a Cripple
for nine Years successively, from
an ill cured Tertian, deserves Observation.
He drank of the Water of
this Place, which is very wholesome
and something Vitriolick, for a Month
together, sometimes to the Quantity
of eight Quarts; he made Urine
plentifully, and came gradually to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the Use of his Hands and Feet; so
that he could both walk and gripe
any thing with his Hands in a short
Time, to the Admiration of all
those who knew his Condition before.
From hence it appears, that
large Quantities of Water do no Mischief,
but by the Pressure are most
powerfully deobstruent. I knew a
gouty Gentleman who drank warm
Beer with great Success in the Gout;
and the <i>Chinese</i>, who drink their
Water warm, are not subject to this
Distemper. There are various Ways
of removing Obstructions, and tempering
the Acrimony of the Juices,
but we are very much in doubt,
whether by these Methods the very
Cause of the Gout can be so thoroughly
extirpated and conveniently
cured, as by the Use of Milk; for
Water drank in too great Quantities
(as it is not endowed with any
nutritious Particles) weakens the
Tone of the Bowels, and damps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
vital heat; though if it be used with
Caution, in Distempers arising from
an Acrimony of the Juices, it is very
often of great Efficacy.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
